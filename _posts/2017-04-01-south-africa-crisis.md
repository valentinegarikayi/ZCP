Recent events in South Africa, especially the opposition of both the South African Communist Party (SACP) and the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) to the continued Presidency of Jacob Zuma have led to many questions and misunderstandings among Zimbabweans — even among some Communists.

Vanguard is therefore re-publishing three statements by the SACP relating to the current crisis.

**THE GUPTAS AREN’T THE ONLY THREAT TO OUR NDR — JUST THE MOST OBVIOUS**

A week in politics, as they say, can be a very long time indeed. At the end of February, in its
Political Report to the Central Committee, the National Secretariat of the Party focused on the
dangers of corporate capture of the state. The report identified the Gupta family as a particularly
dangerous, although not the only, threat in this regard. The political report went on to say:
“It is time now that the SACP and the rest of the working class speak out more forcefully against
these parasites.”

That was just a few weeks ago. At that point in time, the SACP was more or less alone from
within the ANC-led Alliance in publicly condemning the activities of the Gupta family. This was a
few weeks before Comrade Mcebisi Jonas, Deputy Finance Minister, confirmed that he had been
approached by members of the Gupta family in their incessant meddling endeavours in the
appointment (and demotion) of Cabinet Ministers. And it was a few more weeks before the ANC’s
National Executive Committee finally decided to investigate the role of the Guptas. Of course, this
was not the first time that the SACP had raised the alarm around the role and influence of the Gupta
family. At May Day 2013 rallies throughout South Africa, SACP speakers (and at least one ANC
speaker, Secretary-General, Comrade Gwede Mantashe) roundly condemned the shameful landing
of Gupta wedding guests at the Waterkloof airbase the day before. We called for an investigation
into the circumstances. SACP speakers warned of South Africa being turned into a banana republic.
More recently, on behalf of the SACP leadership collective, our Deputy General Secretary,
Comrade Solly Mapaila has led the way in speaking out about the Guptas.
The SACP’s role in all of this has, of course, not pleased everyone. Irvin Jim, in a Daily Maverick
“Opinionista” column, spends more time attacking Comrade Mapaila than the ostensible targets of
his intervention — state corruption and “white monopoly capital”. Jim, with all of his vanguardist
ambitions, is clearly miffed that he is a peripheral voice in this critical struggle. He has only himself
to blame. Jim has marginalised himself because, unlike the SACP, he has failed to understand that,
with all of its risks, the trajectory and contested future of our struggle will still have to be
determined to a considerable extent, one way or another, from within the state and from within the
ANC and the Alliance it leads. Jim has walked away from that responsibility.

The basic line of polemic pursued by Jim is to argue that the Guptas are a distraction from the
“real” corporate capture of the state by “white monopoly capital” (would “black” monopoly capital,
whatever that might mean, be okay?). In this, ironically, Jim is not very far from the counter-
offensive strategy waged by the Gupta-controlled media (The New Age and ANN7). Hired gun
Andile Mngxitama, writing in The New Age, for instance, portrays the attack on the Guptas as a
“story hatched by the global white capital propaganda machine”.

Regular New Age contributor, Pinky Khoabane, argues, in effect, in several columns that if you
think the Guptas are bad what about Johann Rupert and his mega-rich clan? It was Khoabane who
wrongly claimed (she has since back-tracked somewhat) that Rupert flew out from London to meet
with Deputy President, Comrade Cyril Ramaphosa in December to “instruct” the state to hire
Comrade Pravin Gordhan as Finance Minister.

In responding to Jim, Mngxitama, Khoabane and others, it is useful to note that the SACP, in
defence of our democratic national sovereignty and in the face of the dangers of corporate capture,
has not focused exclusively on the Guptas. Take the February Central Committee political report for
instance. Readers will note that, while several paragraphs are certainly directed against the Gupta
family, the Rupert family, the Oppenheimer family, and Koos Bekker’s Naspersempire (a
conglomerate that includes media giants Media 24, Multichoice and extensive printing and
publishing operations) are all critically flagged.
At the same time, we need to analyse more accurately and strategically the different and complex
ways in which capital and its agents (shareholders, CEOs, fund managers, ratings agencies, them
IMF and World Bank, neo-liberal ideological high priests, and their diverse lackeys and hangers-
on) might undermine the democratic mandate of the post-apartheid South African state. Simply
treating corporate capture as a monolithic “plot hatched by global (white) capital”, or, conversely,
as the doings of the Gupta clan, leaves us strategically and tactically disarmed. We are not about to
abolish capitalism globally, and simply dealing with the Guptas won’t make our challenges
miraculously disappear. An effective anti-capitalist, and therefore an effective anti-corporate
capture strategy, needs to understand the terrain much more accurately. Obviously there is not the
space in this brief Editorial Note to undertake a comprehensive analysis. But here are some
pointers.

In the first place, it is important to recognise that, while they will all be hostile to the SACP, the
working class, a radical national democratic revolution and socialism, the Guptas, Bekkers, Ruperts
and Oppenheimers have different and in some respects conflicting agendas.
Johann Rupert’s extensive business empire was inherited largely from his father Anton, a
Broederbonder and at one time the National Party Cape Province’s favoured replacement for
Verwoerd as apartheid Prime Minister. The Rupert empire is centred on two major corporations that
emerged from the South African tobacco giant, Rembrandt — Remgro and Richemont. Remgro is
an investment company headquartered in Stellenbosch with interests in finance, mining and
industry. Richemont is a Swiss-based luxury goods company. The Rupert business empire embraces
hundreds of companies in 35 countries and on six continents. It is an empire that does not depend
on South African government tenders. Johann Rupert can leave the schmoozing of Ministers to
others. He can leave the bullying of the South African government, the heavy lifting to “market
sentiment”, to the ratings agencies, while he enjoys a weekly family meal at the Ruperts-only
reserved table in his favourite Stellenbosch restaurant when he is not on holiday in one of the
family’s properties in the Seychelles or in Onrus.

Koos Bekker’s personal trajectory has both similar and distinct features. Like the Rupert empire,
Bekker’s current empire was based on Afrikaner capital accumulation — in the case of Naspers
dating back to 1914. Several directors and editors in Naspers were prominent apartheid-era
politicians, including DF Malan, Hendrik Verwoerd and PW Botha. As the NP’s favoured
newspaper and school textbook publisher, the company benefited extensively after the NP’s
accession to power in 1948. Bekker’s own involvement in Naspers came in 1985 when, as a young
post-graduate, he helped launch MNet, one of the first two pay TV services anywhere in the world.
Most of the funding came from Naspers. Like the Rupert empire, Naspers is a multi-national. It
operates in 130 countries, and it is listed on the JSE and in London. A major investment and
money-spinner has been the Chinese-based media and entertainment company, Tencent in which
Naspers has a 34% holding. However, unlike Johann Rupert who operates in a somewhat aloof if
not downright disdainful manner towards the post-apartheid ANC-led government, Bekker’s
Naspers South African media have other requirements. They are active within highly regulated
sectors and there have been constant interventions from these corporate quarters to influence and
suborn ANC MPs and government officials.

As numerous SACP statements have indicated, Naspers has, with the connivance of some ANC
politicians and the current leadership of the SABC, subverted and undermined the public mandate
and responsibilities of what is meant to be our public broadcaster. The much-delayed digital
conversion also has everything to do with Naspers interference and partial corporate state capture.
By contrast with both the Ruperts and Bekkers, the Gupta family, arriving in South Africa in the
mid-1990s, has been entirely parasitic for their wealth accumulation on corrupting parts of the post-
apartheid state. In particular, they have targeted key parastatals, among them Eskom, Transnet,
Denel and SAA, as well as provincial governments. The Ruperts and Bekkers, part of the so-called
Stellenbosch mafia, appear to have some degree of commitment to South Africa, presumably both
for wealth preservation and sentimental cultural reasons. (Rupert is reported to have cancelled all
Richemont advertising in an overseas publication that once crassly described Afrikaans as “the
ugliest language in the world”.) The Ruperts and Bekkers repatriate some of their considerable
global earnings back into South Africa. By contrast, the Gupta family is reputed to be shipping its
ill-acquired wealth post-haste out of the country to Dubai in anticipation of a lossm of political
influence in the near-term.

A greater attachment to South Africa does not mean that Rupert and Bekker are “good capitalists”
while the Guptas are “bad capitalists”. Nor does the difference between a Remgro and a Naspers
make Johann Rupert a nicer capitalist than Koos Bekker. Capitalism itself, however innovative,
dynamic and durable it can sometimes be, is a thoroughly exploitative system, and, in civilizational
and ecological terms, it is unsustainable. The SACP is not alone in recognising this reality: the
current head of the Roman Catholic Church, Pope Francis, for instance, is outspoken in his
recognition of this fact.

For the SACP it is not the Ruperts, or the Bekkers, or the Guptas, but capitalism as a global
system that constitutes our principal and formidable strategic challenge. But how to deal with it?
How do we safeguard our hard-won democracy? How do we defend our electoral mandate? How do
we roll back the profit-maximising agenda of capital? What tactical and strategic programmes do
we undertake?

Again, within the confines of an Editorial Note, we can only indicate some issues in broad brush-
strokes. So let’s take one topical area. If we are to advance a second radical phase of the National
Democratic Revolution, as we surely must, we require among other things a strategically
disciplined, professional National Treasury and South African Revenue Service (SARS). The
Guptas’ smash-and-grab, parasitic agenda has no such interest. A National Treasury that blows the
whistle on the squandering of public resources on corrupt tenders, or that asks rational questions
about a mega nuclear build programme, or a SARS that probes high income earners, are all
anathema to the Guptas.

By contrast, the Ruperts and Bekkers for both sentimental and wealth preservation reasons, would
like to see an effective Treasury and SARS capable of staving off a South African economic
meltdown. But for them and much of the rest of South African monopoly capital, a strategically
disciplined and professional Treasury and SARS would be institutions that essentially imposed a
neo-liberal, investor friendly macro-economic policy programme that continued to lock South
Africa into its semi-peripheral global positioning within the wider imperialist value chain.
Against the parasitic agenda of the Guptas and others, the SACP supports the defence of a strong
and professionally effective Treasury and SARS, but the strategic discipline we have in mind is
radically different from that of the Ruperts and Bekkers. We recognise the imperative for macro-
economic, monetary and fiscal strategic discipline and professionalism in support of a radical
second phase of the NDR. This includes macro-economic policy aligned to re-industrialisation, a
major state-led infrastructure spend programme, job creation and sustainable social redistribution.
In short, we require an effective Treasury and SARS, along with development finance institutions,
which form important pillars of a democratic, developmental state. This is the only way that we can
begin to roll back the neo-liberal agenda of the Ruperts and Bekkers.~ 37 ~
But the very state and parastatal instruments required for this developmental agenda are the ones
that are actively and wilfully eroded by the Gupta agenda. In short, exposing and putting an end to
the parasitism of the Guptas and others like them is not a diversion from confronting monopoly
capital as personified by the Ruperts and the Bekkers. Defeating parasitism is essential to
confronting monopoly capital and advancing, deepening and defending our National Democratic
Revolution.
