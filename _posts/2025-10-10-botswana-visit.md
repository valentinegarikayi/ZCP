## GENERAL SECRETARY VISITS BOTSWANA FOR A BILATERAL MEETING WITH THE BOTSWANA NATIONAL FRONT (BNF)

**9th October 2025**

On the 9th of October 2025, the Zimbabwe Communist Party (ZCP) General Secretary, Cde
Ngqabutho Nicholas Mabhena, held a bilateral meeting in Botswana with members of the
Botswana National Front (BNF) Central Committee.

The meeting was attended by Cde Moses Bantsi, BNF National Chairman; Cde Shawn Nthaile,
Deputy Secretary General; and Cde Bakang Lesole, Secretary for International Relations.

Discussions focused on geopolitics, the imperialist war in Ukraine, and the ongoing genocide in
Gaza. Both parties jointly called for an immediate end to the imperialist war in Ukraine and
strongly condemned the genocidal actions of Israel in Gaza.

The meeting underscored the urgent need to build a strong Pan-African solidarity movement
capable of dismantling neo-colonialism and pushing back against imperialist influence on the
continent. The resistance against French imperialism in the Sahel region was highlighted as an
inspiration for progressive forces across the SADC region.

The ZCP General Secretary also briefed the meeting on the political and economic crisis in
Zimbabwe, urging the BNF to use its influence to encourage regional pressure on Zimbabwean
political leaders to ensure that elections are held in full compliance with SADC principles and
guidelines on democratic, free, and fair elections.

On the issue of migration, the meeting noted Botswana’s ongoing development of a migration
policy aimed at making it easier for Africans to visit, work, and invest in Botswana — a positive
step towards African integration and unity.

Both parties reaffirmed their commitment to continued dialogue and cooperation, with delegates
expected to report back to their respective Central Committees for further engagement and joint
program development.
