## STATEMENT BY THE ZIMBABWE COMMUNIST PARTY ON THE GENERAL SECRETARY'S VISIT TO BOTSWANA

**8th October 2025**

The Zimbabwe Communist Party (ZCP) wishes to inform the public that its General Secretary, Cde Ngqabutho Nicholas Mabhena, will be in Botswana on Thursday, 9 October 2025, for an official engagement with the Botswana National Front (BNF).

The Botswana National Front is the largest party within the Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC), the coalition currently governing Botswana.

This meeting seeks to strengthen fraternal relations between the ZCP and the BNF, as both parties share a common vision for progressive and people-centred governance across the region. The engagement comes at a crucial moment when Africa is seeking alternative paths of developmentâ€”outside the control and dictates of institutions such as the IMF and World Bank.
