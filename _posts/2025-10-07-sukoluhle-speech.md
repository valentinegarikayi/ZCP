## SPEECH BY THE ARTUZ INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS SECRETARY, CDE SUKHOLUHLE NDLOVU

**7th October 2025**

Comrades, Sisters, and Brothers in Struggle,

Esteemed Leaders of NEHAWU and the WFTU,

Revolutionary Greetings from the militant educators of Zimbabwe!

As we mark 80 years of the WFTU’s fearless internationalism, ARTUZ stands shoulder-to-shoulder with NEHAWU – our comrades who turned the struggle against apartheid into a global beacon. Our histories bleed together: from the Soweto Uprising to the Chimurenga trenches, we fought colonialism with one heart. But today, we face a common enemy: a dying capitalism that poisons our planet, divides our class, and steals our future!

## The Triple Crisis: Capitalism’s War on People & Planet

While the comprador elite loots our resources, they leave behind ecological wastelands. In Zimbabwe and South Africa, climate collapse is not abstract – it’s dried-up rivers, failed harvests, and cyclones drowning our communities. Yet the very corporations causing this disaster now profit from "green" colonialism, grabbing African lithium and platinum while leaving our people jobless!
Simultaneously, global fascism is rising. From the targeting of South Africa by Donald Trump – who slanders your land reform as "white genocide" to justify imperialist intervention – to the surge of far-right forces exploiting despair across Europe and the Americas. Their goal? To pit worker against worker, nation against nation.
Capitalism’s Toxic Fallout: Xenophobia, GBV & Social Decay

When capitalism fails, it breeds reaction. Xenophobic violence – sponsored by elites to divert anger from their looting – shames our Pan-African dream. It is the same system that fuels gender-based violence through poverty and patriarchy, and floods our townships with drugs to numb revolutionary consciousness. An attack on a Nigerian trader in Durban is an attack on a Zimbawean teacher in Bulawayo!
The Socialist Path: Reclaiming Africa’s Destiny

Comrades, survival demands system change

## State-Led Industrialization & Ecological Justice

Africa’s mineral wealth must fund a Just Transition. State-owned beneficiation plants can create millions of green jobs while powering schools, hospitals, and renewable energy grids. No more raw exports!

## Decolonized Education for African Genius
Our curricula remain chained to colonial mindsets. We need education that teaches African science, history, and socialist economics – training engineers to process our minerals, doctors to heal our people, and revolutionaries to lead our continent!

## Smash the Comprador Bourgeoisie
Corruption isn’t an aberration – it’s capitalism’s core function. The same elites stealing Zimbabwe’s diamonds and South Africa’s SOEs are selling our sovereignty to imperialists. They must be uprooted by democratic worker control of the economy!

## Salute the Resistance: From General Z to Gaza
We salute the fearless Africa’s General Z – challenging dictatorship in the streets! But street energy alone isn’t enough. We must provide revolutionary political education to ensure this generation’s fury delivers structural change, not just hashtag revolutions.
Our solidarity crosses oceans: We stand with Palestine! Israel’s genocide, backed by U.S. bombers, mirrors the violence of Rhodesian settler colonialism. Freedom is indivisible!

## Building the Revolutionary Front
In South Africa, we salute the SACP’s fight in the coming elections. Your battle against neoliberal capture is our battle! In Zimbabwe, ARTUZ is building a Left Front – workers, students, war veterans, and peasants – to complete our liberation: to seize the economy from the cartel state!
WFTU: Our Shield and Sword in Dark Times

## On its 80th anniversary, we demand the WFTU

Lead a global campaign against climate colonialism and for worker-led Just Transitions.

Mobilize against fascism and imperialist hybrid warfare targeting nations like South Africa.

Build mass political education programs to arm young workers with Marxist theory.

## Comrades, the hour is late but the path is clear:

1. Unite Africa – Break colonial borders! Build worker-run industries!
2. Decolonize Minds – Education for liberation, not exploitation!
3. End Gender Terror – Working-class feminism or barbarism!
4. Globalize Struggle – From Marikana to Gaza, one fight against capital!
NEHAWU! WFTU! ARTUZ!
One Struggle, One Future – A Socialist Africa!
Aluta Continua! ✊🏾 Palestine is Unconquerable!
