**ZIMBABWE COMMUNIST PARTY POLITICAL ECONOMY**

POLICY DOCUMENT

# Section 1: A Brief History of the Political Economy of Zimbabwe

1. The history of Zimbabwe’s current political economy starts in 1890 with the arrival of the
Pioneer Column. Colonization soon swept away the previous relations of production and replaced it
by capitalism. Historically, Zimbabwe had traded with the Arabs, Swahilis, Portuguese, Indians and
Chinese in gold and ivory, but in the main there was peasant production of grain in the form of
different varieties of sorghum and millet, vegetables, goats and cattle. The degree of importance of
livestock rearing in relation to crop-growing varied according to the amount of rainfall and of soil
conditions found in different parts of the country. In some areas, communal-patriarchal relations of
production had given way to a form of feudalism and the beginning of class society. Here and there,
there were still hunter-gatherers. But from at least as early as the 14th century, there was a small
class of traders linked to hereditary leaders.
2. The colonizers simultaneously brought with them both modern infrastructural development and
racial oppression. They determined the shape of the country which was at first called “British South
Africa” and from 1895 “Rhodesia”.
3. European settlers did not enter the country which we now call Zimbabwe simply to oppress black
people; they came for economic reasons which were dictated by the development of capitalism in
Europe through the 19th century until it had reached its monopoly stage. Small capitalists had been
swallowed by big capitalists. Capitalism needed to grow through the export of capital to make more
profit and through the ever-increasing need for raw materials both from mining and agriculture. In
1885, the leaders of the contesting European capitalist countries came together at the Berlin
Conference and divided Africa between them. Prior to that, European capital had been content with
trading ports around the African coast but few had ventured into the interior. The percentage of
Africa belonging to European Powers was 11% in 1876, and 90% in 1900
4. In 1916, in his book Imperialism the Highest Stage of Capitalism V.I. Lenin made this summary
of the main features of imperialism:

(1) The concentration of production and capital has developed to such a high stage that it has
created monopolies which play a decisive role in economic life;
(2) The merging of bank capital with industrial capital, and the creation, on the basis of this
“finance capital”, of a financial oligarchy;
(3) The export of capital as distinguished from the export of commodities acquires
exceptional importance;
(4) The formation of international monopolist capitalist associations which share the world
among themselves;
(5) The territorial division of the whole world among the biggest capitalist powers is
completed. Imperialism is capitalism at that stage of development at which the dominance of
monopolies and finance capital is established; in which the export of capital has acquired
pronounced importance; in which the division of the world among the international trusts has
begun, in which the division of all territories of the globe among the biggest capitalist powers
has been completed.”

5. Lenin also quoted Cecil Rhodes in Imperialism the Highest Stage of Capitalism:
“I was in the East End of London [a working-class quarter] yesterday and attended a meeting
of the unemployed. I listened to the wild speeches, which were just a cry for ‘bread! bread!’
and on my way home I pondered over the scene and I became more than ever convinced of
the importance of imperialism... My cherished idea is a solution for the social problem, i.e. in
order to save the 40,000,000 inhabitants of the United Kingdom from a bloody civil war, we
colonial statesmen must acquire new lands to settle the surplus population, to provide new
markets for the goods produced in the factories and mines. The Empire, as I have always said,
is a bread and butter question. If you want to avoid civil war, you must become imperialists.”
6. The Pioneer Column was not a project of the British Government; it was planned and financed by
the British South Africa Company a joint-stock company under the leadership of Cecil Rhodes
looking principally for profit.
7. It was J.V. Stalin in 1924 who in his book The Foundations of Leninism pointed out:
“The third contradiction is the contradiction between the handful of ruling, ‘civilized’ nations
and the hundreds of millions of the colonial and dependent peoples of the world. Imperialism
is the most barefaced exploitation and the most inhuman oppression of hundreds of millions
of people inhabiting vast colonies and dependent countries. The purpose of this exploitation
and of this oppression is to squeeze out super-profits. But in exploiting these countries
imperialism is compelled to build there railways, factories and mills, industrial and
commercial centres. The appearance of a class of proletarians, the emergence of a native
intelligentsia, the awakening of national consciousness, the growth of the liberation movement
— such are the inevitable results of this ‘policy’. The growth of the revolutionary movement
in all colonies and dependent countries without exception clearly testifies to this fact. This
circumstance is of importance for the proletariat inasmuch as it saps radically the position of
capitalism by converting the colonies and dependent countries from reserves of imperialism
into reserves of the proletarian revolution.”
8. The truth of Stalin’s statement is born out in Zimbabwe by the fact that despite the co-ordination
of the different ethnic groups across Zimbabwe in the resistance war which began in Matabeleland
1893 and later spread across the country due to the influence of the Kalanga religious leader
Makwati (Mukwati), they could not defeat the imperialist colonizers. Spears could not defeat
Maxim machine-guns. The old system of chiefs and kings was either swept away of made
subservient to the Rhodesian administration. The colonizers built infrastructure, railways, coal-
mines, power stations. Hut tax was imposed so that young men would have to work in the mines or
for other European businesses in order to earn money to pay that tax. Thus there was the beginning
of a native proletariat. Resistance was not led, for the most part, by the old traditional leaders, but
rather by the young men trained in the mission schools who were part of the new system.
9. The colonization of Zimbabwe and South Africa was, however, different from that further north.
In most of Africa, imperialism sought at that time only to plunder minerals or to establish
plantations. In Rhodesia and South Africa the Europeans who came to settle were trying to establish
a permanent home. So, despite their arrogant racism, they built an infrastructure based on European
standards and at the same time, especially for those of working class origins, established for
themselves living standards of which they could only dream in Europe; black servants became the
norm for people who had never had servants in their place of origin.
10. From 1890 to 1923, Southern Rhodesia (as well as Northern Rhodesia) was ruled by the British
South Africa Company. The settlers of Southern Rhodesia, however, did not want permanent rule
from a board of directors whom they had no say in choosing; they petitioned the British
Government, and, following a whites-only referendum, were given “Responsible Government”.
Mindful, even then, that unlike Australia, New Zealand, Canada and even South Africa that whites
were only a small minority, the British Government did not give Southern Rhodesia official
Dominion status; but with its own Parliament, it was, in fact, run in a similar way to the Dominions.
With power in their hands, the Rhodesian settlers established an infrastructure of roads and
railways. Wankie Colliery supplied coal for the provision of electricity and in the 1960s the Kariba
Dam supplied hydro-electricity. Iron ore was mined in the Midlands and the state-owned Rhosteel
(later Ziscosteel) became the centre of the steel industry.
11. In agriculture, the 1930 Land Act divided the land into white-owned land and African-owned
land. About half the land was allocated to the white minority and about half to the black majority.
In general, the best land was given to the white minority. Although there were a number of
subsequent Acts which modified the original Act in one way or another, sometimes giving
concessions to Africans and at other times taking more land away from them, the pattern of land
ownership remained more or less the same until Independence in1980 and for some time after.
12. Of great commercial importance were tobacco, sugar and tea with cotton coming somewhat
later. pine forests were established in Manicaland by the Forestry Commission and there were large
agro-industrial estates responsible for tea and sugar.
13. Although it is true that 70% of maize was produced by black communal farmers, it is also true
that 70% of the population lived in the rural areas. The cities, then, were supplied with most of their
staple food through the efforts of the white commercial farmers.
14. The white farmers also set up collective marketing organizations. Dairyboard, Cotton Marketing
Board, Grain Marketing Board etc. as well as Farmers Co-op as a consumer co-operative.
15. Private industry grew up in the towns and cities but workers were very poorly paid. The fact
that most male workers relied in part for their maintenance on their women-folk producing food on
the communal land only served to drive the wage levels down. In 1948, Southern Rhodesia
experienced a General Strike organized by black workers. Subsequently government was forced to
try to alleviate working conditions.
16. 1945 marked the end of the Second World War. Though today it is often portrayed in movies as
a victory for the USA and Britain, the reality, which people at that time understood, was that the
main burden of the fighting was taken up by the Soviet Union. Even outside the Soviet Union, the
main resistance movements in Europe, especially those of France Italy, Greece, Albania and
Yugoslavia were led by Communists. In the Far East also, it was the Communists in China,
Vietnam and Korea who seriously fought Imperial Japan, the ally of Nazi Germany in Asia.
17. In 1945, soon after the end of the war the 6th Pan-African Congress (was held in Manchester,
Britain. With the defeat of fascism in Europe came the demand for African independence.~ 11 ~
18. In the early1950s, Gamal Abdel Nasser seized power in the British semi-colony of Egypt
throwing out the corrupt King Feisal; soon after, the first major anti-colonial war in Africa took
place in the French colony of Algeria. In Kenya the Land and Freedom Army, better known as the
Mau Mau killed a handful of white settlers initiating a brutal response from Britain in which
thousands of Kenyans were massacred and thousands more tortured. It was clear that the tide of
African nationalism could not be stopped. Jointly, Britain and France adopted a new policy — neo-
colonialism. “You can have your black President, National Flag and National Anthem — we will
control your economy.”
19. During the 1960s there was a rapid move by Britain and France to grant “Independence” to
African countries. However, in doing so, a great deal of power was given to the greedy black élite
which yearned for the living standards of the European colonizers without having their
organizational skills, or even the understanding of capitalism of their former masters — and, in fact,
their former masters were not, for the most part really “former”. They simply receded into the
background, still reaping the profits but without direct control.
20. As early as 1961, the African writer Frantz Fanon had this to say in the chapter The Pitfalls of
National Consciousness in his famous book The Wretched of the Earth:
“The objective of nationalist parties...is... strictly national. They mobilize the people with
slogans of independence, and for the rest leave it to future events. When such parties are,
questioned on the economic programme of the state that they are clamouring for... they are
incapable of replying, because, precisely, they are completely ignorant of the economy of their
own country.
“In underdeveloped countries, we have seen that no true bourgeoisie exists; there is only a
sort of little greedy caste, avid and voracious, with the mind of a huckster, only too glad to
accept the dividends that the former colonial power hands out to it. This get-rich-quick
middle class shows itself incapable of great ideas or of inventiveness. It remembers what it has
read in European textbooks and imperceptibly it becomes not even the replica of Europe, but
its caricature.”
21. After the granting of “Independence” to countries further north, when dealing with southern
Africa the imperialists were faced with a problem. There were white settler regimes in place put
there during an earlier stage of imperialism. It was obvious that they could not survive. Worse (in
terms of the interests of the imperialists) in the Portuguese colonies, the liberation movements of
Angola and Mozambique in particular had strong links with the underground Portuguese
Communist Party — and with the Soviet Union. In South Africa, the main liberation movement, the
African National Congress (ANC) was strongly influenced by the underground Communist Party
and was supported by the Soviet Union. In Zimbabwe, from 1962, the liberation movement, the
Zimbabwe African People’s Union (ZAPU), had established strong links with the Soviet Union.
The task, then, for the imperialists, was to replace the out-dated white settler regimes by black
regimes — but not by Communists! The new rulers must be willing tools of monopoly capitalist, in
particular mining interests.
22. Further, local southern African whites had to some degree, set up semi-autonomous economies
outside of the direct control of imperialism. This was not too popular in Europe and America.
23. By 1965, and under pressure from the Commonwealth, Britain put sanctions against the
intransigent Rhodesian Government. The imperialists were manoeuvring towards the establishment
of a black neo-colonial government. The growing ties between ZAPU and the socialist world were
not part of that plan; British intelligence manufactured a split in the movement, using as an excuse
that the leader, Nkomo was a “member of a minority tribe”. The Zimbabwe African National Union
(ZANU), ostensibly more militant, was born in 1963 and, with the assistance of the imperialist
powers, was to come to power in 1980.
24. In 1965, the Rhodesian minority, unwilling to grant the vote to the black majority as demanded
by the British government, made their “Unilateral Declaration of Independence” (UDI), and
following the imposition of economic sanctions by Britain, began to build economic autonomy.
True, a lot of sanctions-busting took place, but state planning and control was strengthened.
25. By the time the Independence of Zimbabwe came in 1980, the economy was very strong. The
Rhodesian dollar (and subsequently the Zimbabwe dollar) was valued at higher than the British
pound. But there was a problem in that a great deal of the African population expected to quickly
achieve the living standards enjoyed by the small white minority.
26. It should be noted here, that 1980, the year of Zimbabwe’s Independence also marked the
beginning of the neo-liberal agenda of privatization and removal of controls from the banking
system; this took off world-wide when Margaret Thatcher became British Prime Minister in 1979
Ronald Reagan became US President in 1981.
27. This trend was further deepened by the computer revolution which facilitated the movement of
money around the world and created the conditions whereby money was used to make more money
rapidly and with only a loose relationship to actual production. This trend has led internationally to
a few people becoming very rich in the midst of an increasing number of predatory wars started by
the United States and its allies and an increase in world poverty and human trafficking.
28. Following Zimbabwean Independence, the Rhodesian system remained in place and during the
1980s there was a modest increase in real wages and the living standards of the African majority.
There was some import substitution, but there was little innovation or infrastructural planning.
29. In the late 1980s we saw the first major outbreak of the “shiny disease”.
What is the “shiny disease”?
The shiny disease is the idea that we must have the latest shiny technology, whether or not it is
appropriate for our specific needs. Thus, for example, the tendency is for emergent business people
will buy the latest Mercedes Benz rather than a 4x4 bakkie even if their home is in a rural area
without proper roads.
30. Nationally, it was decided that steam locomotives were too old-fashioned — despite the fact
that Zimbabwe has known coal deposits that can last at least another 300 years — but does not have
oil. Further, at the time of Independence in 1980, Zimbabwe was manufacturing its own steam
locomotives.
31. National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) asked Canada for advice on how to modernize. The
Canadians of course advised Zimbabwe to buy diesel locomotives from them — and also spare
parts. Because of this, Zimbabwe also had to increase its import of diesel. Steam locomotives are
more labour intensive than diesel, but because everything connected with diesel locomotives had to
be imported, they became more expensive. Zimbabwe, therefore, paid out a great deal of valuable
forex in order to make Zimbabweans unemployed.

32. Until 1991, the Zimbabwe Dollar was not convertible outside the country. Not making one’s
currency available on the international market DOES create some bottlenecks. Therefore during the
1980s Zimbabwe was sometimes unable to import the constituents of toothpaste or of match-heads.
Youth wanted Nike takkies rather than North Star. The idea grew that foreign made is better. There
are many stories of people boasting about products purchased in other countries, only to discover
that those very products were made in Zimbabwe.
33. In this period, the Finance Minister Bernard Chidzero proved to be efficient at his job. He was a
good accountant. Unfortunately the ZANU(PF) government — ZANU was by now adding
“Patriotic Front” to its name to become ZANU(PF) — did not understand the difference between
accountancy and political economy. It was Chidzero who championed the neo-liberal agenda in
Zimbabwe from within government. There was also pressure from the imperialist powers which had
installed ZANU(PF) and Mugabe as the government of Zimbabwe. This pressure was strengthened
by the fact that East European socialism was in crisis (political rather than economic).
34. Through a combination of these factors, Zimbabwe was pushed into the Economic Structural
Adjustment Programme (ESAP) put together by the World Bank and the IMF. This was the real
beginning of the neo-liberal agenda in Zimbabwe. Immediately both luxury goods and cheap
imports poured into the shops. The ZimDollar started to rapidly decline in value. Factories closed,
wage levels dropped and unemployment rose. ZANU(PF) had by this time swallowed ZAPU and
the élite became ever more remote from their constituents.
35. Trade unionists justifiably began to discuss the formation of a labour party; but they had no
funding. Simultaneously, the white farmers who had grabbed land following the 1930 Land Act, in
1994 successfully challenged a law which would have taken land away from them without
compensation. Then came the Congo War; following the demise of Mobutu Sese Seko, Laurent
Kabila was installed as the new President of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). He refused to
follow the dictates of those who had put him there, demanding that those mining in Congo should
put money back into Congo. The United States used its puppet states of Uganda and Rwanda to
invade the DRC under CIA direction and with the latest US weaponry. Zimbabwe sent troops and
immediately lost the support it had long enjoyed from Western imperialism. The IMF and World
Bank removed funding from Zimbabwe (while continuing to fund Uganda and Rwanda). This was
the first stage of sanctions, the second being the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery
Act (ZIDERA) which became official US policy in 2001.
36. Towards the end of 1998, about three months after the start of the DRC War, the British
diplomat and MI.6 agent Linsey called together divergent strands of the opposition and asked them
to create a well-funded new party; in the following year this was to become the Movement for
Democratic Change (MDC), a party of militant but politically confused trade unionists, on the one
hand and white farmers and other remnants of the Rhodesian Front on the other. This odd grouping
came together against a united but corrupt national liberation movement in which the parasitic black
bourgeoisie was becoming increasingly dominant.
37. One of the main players in this conundrum was the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions
(ZCTU), the main body uniting the workers but advised by Godfrey Kanyenze an employee of
arch-capitalist George Soros through his virulently anti-Communist “Open Society Initiative”.
38. Instead of organizing against sanctions and boosting production like their Rhodesian forbears,
the Zimbabwe élite increased its plunder. The land occupations started by former freedom fighters
in 2000 became a means for the élite to grab land for themselves, in many cases expelling the
peasants who had been resettled earlier, in others treating the farm labourers on the commercial
farms even worse than their former white employers. Black empowerment became the
empowerment of the élite who now wished to take over ALL white owned businesses, whether or
not they had the ability to run them.
39. Since then, the most devastating thing that has happened economically is that the skilled
workforce has been effectively expelled from Zimbabwe by the new capitalists who do not
understand that in order to continue exploiting the labour power of the worker, then he must be paid
regularly. A small minority have become exceedingly wealthy while the working-class goes on
strike not for increased wages, but merely to be paid.

# Section 2: Moving Forward

40. There IS a solution. We cannot hope that China or the West is going to bail out Zimbabwe while
Zimbabweans stand with their arms folded. We have to rebuild our economy based on National
Planning and Production. The National Plan must involve the whole population and the whole
population must benefit. There must be a Development Plan in every District and in every town.
There must be a Development Plan in every Province agreed by the people and linked to the
National Plan This is what we mean by Devolution of Power. Devolution must also involve the
huge Zimbabwean Diaspora. Tribalism and racialism are the enemies of nation building. Our new
Zimbabwe must be based on national consciousness linked to hard work.
41. Socialism cannot be built overnight. The building of a National Democratic Economy is the first
step towards a socialist Zimbabwe. The building of a National Democratic Economy is the
necessary intermediate stage between that of social production but private ownership (capitalism)
and the social ownership of the means of production and social stability (socialism).
42. In 2009, the South African government produced a Green Paper on the question of National
Planning; unfortunately, since then, most of the concepts advanced in that Green Paper have been
severely undermined by predatory class interests when it comes to implementation. Nevertheless, it
gives a clear idea of what has been happening internationally and is worth quoting from and an
indication of the way forward:
“The collapse of the Soviet bloc in the 80s, coupled with the mixed success of the newly
independent post-colonial states saw a decline of interest in and the prestige of development
planning processes. This coincided with the dominance of what became known as the
Washington Consensus, a conservative approach to economic management with a limited role
for the State.
“Paradoxically, during this period, growing attention was being paid to long term strategic
planning in capitalist firms. They had also discovered that, in complex organizations, it was
impossible to make meaningful use of large volumes of detailed information in conditions of
substantial external uncertainty, which became evident at time scales longer than a few years.~ 15 ~
“However, shareholders and managers still needed to guide the evolution of their
organizations. As a consequence, while formerly centrally planned nations were abandoning
structured, planned state intervention, large firms, which were not subject to the same
ideological constraints, continued to plan but developed new methodologies that were more
appropriate to the complex and uncertain environments in which they operated.
“The success, in particular, of the East Asian countries which experienced explosive and
sustained growth highlights the importance of focusing not only on the form of institutions
and the capacity of the state, but also on mobilization of the public service and all of society
behind a long-term vision.
“Strategic long-term planning and the institutions underpinning it should be rooted in the
traditions of each society and aimed at its socio-economic imperatives.
“Clear justification and motivation existed as to why the societies of East Asia embraced
certain policies and it was the underlying political and social processes that determined the
form and quality of the institutions to drive growth and development. Japan felt that the only
way it could be an important global player was by becoming an industrial power house. In
Malaysia, inter-racial tensions, which reached their highest point in the 1960s, propelled the
country to consider national strategic planning to expand the economic base, and to ensure
more equitable distribution of resources and national unity. In the late 1970s and 1980s
Thailand’s external security concerns were amongst the incentives for structural
transformation.
“The outcomes of strategic national development planning have also been vastly different.
The Philippines had a higher Gross National Product (GNP) per capita than Malaysia in the
1950s and Thailand in the 1970s. By 1990 Malaysia’s GNP per capita was three times and
Thailand’s almost twice that of the Philippines even though the Philippines also set up a
planning and co-ordination machinery. Instructively, in the Philippines, the core decision-
making structures comprised four oversight agencies responsible for economic policy-making
with little co-ordination between them. In contrast Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea have
much stronger interagency co-ordination to plan and execute the development plan
concentrated in the office of the head of government.
“A common striking feature of the successful states, particularly Malaysia, has been effective
co-ordination and linking of the central co-ordinating agencies into the machinery of the
development planning process — the Ministries of Finance, Industry and Public Service and
Administration for example are closely linked to the bodies responsible for planning and
implementation co-ordination in the Prime Minister’s office.”
GREEN PAPER: Annexure 1, Lessons from International Experience
“Lack of a coherent long term plan has weakened our ability to provide clear and consistent
policies. It has limited our capacity to mobilize all of society in pursuit of our developmental
objectives. It has hampered our efforts to priorities resource allocations and to drive the
implementation of government’s objectives and priorities. In addition, weaknesses in co-
ordination of government have led to policy inconsistencies and, in several cases, poor service
delivery outcomes.”
GREEN PAPER: Preface by Trevor Manuel (then South African Minister of Finance)

# Section 3: A Plan for Zimbabwe

## NATIONAL PLAN

43. There can be no long term solution for the problems of Zimbabwe unless production is put
first. Zimbabwe has abundant natural resources and it is the harnessing of these resources with an
understanding of priorities through a national plan that there can be any national recovery.
Following the lead of other countries with fast developing economies, we need to establish a
National Planning Commission. It should be broad based and transparent. Provincial and District
Planning Commissions should draw-up local plans in consultation with the people. In order to
accomplish this we need a Draft National Plan to be drawn up by planning professionals working in
conjunction with representatives of industry and trade unions as well as regional representatives.
44. The Draft National Plan needs to be discussed in every Ward and village. Every Town and
District should have a Development Plan implemented with the assistance and oversight of a
permanent, broad-based Planning Committee. Every Province must have a Provincial Plan and a
permanent, broad-based Planning Commission. There must be an over-arching National Plan and a
permanent, broad-based National Planning Commission. The Zimbabwean Diaspora must be
involved in developing and financing the National Plan.
45. Planning Committees at lower levels need to be dominated by people at local level. Planning at
the higher levels will require a greater input by planning professionals. However, we will need
mutual sympathy between the professionals and the people who are involved directly in production.
Professional planners need not be arrogant to those involved directly in production — and those
involved directly in production should not have an obstructive or dismissive attitude towards the
professional planners. The development of our country, Zimbabwe, must always be the priority.
46. In implementing the National Plan, the commanding heights of the economy should be publicly
owned through parastatals or in some cases by enterprises under Provincial, Municipal or District
ownership. All enterprises privatized since ESAP must be restored to public ownership.
Parastatals
47. We will need strong, efficient parastatals staffed by competent professionals recruited for their
expertise and experience. Though there should be political appointees to the boards of parastatals to
monitor adherence to the National Plan and to national development policies, they must be always
outnumbered by appropriately trained professionals. Appointments made on the basis of nepotism
or cronyism must not be allowed.
48. Whenever possible, parastatals should be self-contained and working for the national interest,
by which we mean principally the interests of the working-class and peasantry. Parastatals should
engage with the private sector locally or with foreign investors to create joint ventures only when
and where this is necessary and appropriate in the interests of efficient production, i.e. when
we need expertise either in production or distribution or the acquisition of machinery which would
otherwise be unavailable. This proviso must never be abused by unscrupulous ‘business people`
with no real skills

## BANKING

49. The first principle of banking in a restored Zimbabwe is that banking must serve productive
industry and not be used to suck its life-blood and eventually destroy it. Banking and accountancy
must be used to assess and regulate growing production.
50. It is self-evident that banking should be well regulated and under strict government supervision.
51. The global melt-down of 2008 was wholly caused by the corrupt US banking system.
52. The melt-down in Zimbabwe in 2004 was wholly caused by the corrupt Zimbabwean banking
system.
53. All banking regulations in force in Zimbabwe prior to ESAP in 1991 must be restored with
immediate effect.
54. In particular, the duplum rule must be re-introduced and enforced. (This forbids, even through
compound interest, interest becoming more than the original sum. Thus under this rule it is unlawful
to try to recover more than twice the amount of money originally loaned.)
55. Securitisation of loans must be banned with immediate effect.
56. Banks which flout the regulations must have their banking licenses revoked and their assets
confiscated.
57. There must be harsh laws against the buying and selling of currency. Individuals engaged in
illegal currency selling must be punished through the confiscation of all assets, including family
houses. Churches or other institutions engaged in such activities must have all their assets
confiscated and face closure.
58. Half of all gold produced in Zimbabwe must be kept in the country and go into the vaults of the
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe in order to give strength to the currency.
59. A strong, government-owned National Bank must be established.
60. Co-operative Banks should be established by the people with government assistance.
61. Close ties must be established with the BRICS Bank as the only credible alternative
internationally recognized banking system.
62. In order to create a production oriented banking system geared to the needs of national
economic recovery, Government must establish an expert Commission to study and report back on
the banking system so that a new and effective system can be established. Foreign as well as local
experts need to be recruited on to that Commission. The following need to be studied as part of the
Commissions work:
1) The Zimbabwe banking system prior to ESAP.
2) The banking systems of former socialist countries (such as the USSR, Yugoslavia and Hungary)
those countries following a socialist path today (Cuba, China, Vietnam) and those countries which
have successfully followed a semi-independent growth strategy (Bolivia, Nicaragua, Malaysia).
3) The recovery of Iceland after its banking melt-down.
4) Islamic Banking.
5) Co-operative banking (especially in Brazil and Bangla Desh).
6) The BRICS Bank, Banco del Sud and other relatively progressive international banking
organizations.

## PLANNING PRIORITIES

63. The two most basic economic priorities needed for self-sufficiency and therefore form the base
for national sovereignty are food and energy. Energy includes both electricity and fuel.
64. Water is a major problem in Zimbabwe as rainfall has declined since Independence in 1980
while the population has grown. The problems of agriculture involve reduced rainfall just as much
as chaotic land reform. However, the problem of water supply is not only about the building and
maintenance of dams, it is also about pumping the water to wherever it is needed, therefore
electricity supply becomes the most important single factor in infrastructural development and
economic recovery.
On electrical power:
65. The current coal-fired power stations are performing far below capacity and need refurbishing.
66. Hydro-electric power from Victoria Falls and Kariba Dam need to be upgrade. Kariba Dam is in
danger of collapse: if this happens it will be a catastrophe not only for Zimbabwe but for Zambia
and Mozambique too.
67. Solar Power needs to be greatly increased with factories producing both solar water-heating and
solar electric panels. In the rural areas these can be used in conjunction with establishment of wood
lots and the use of wood-burning stoves to reduce deforestation and the amount of time spent by
women on the collection of firewood. Street lighting and traffic lights should be solar powered
throughout Zimbabwe, thus reducing the need for mains electricity supply.
68. A gas-fired power station must be built at Lupane using the so far untapped natural gas. The use
of natural gas directly can reduce the demand for electricity for domestic cooking and also for some
industrial operations.
On liquid fuel:
69. Zimbabwe has enormous coal reserves but no oil. We have the capacity to at least partially
overcome our fuel problems through the following:
70. Putting our whole railway system back to steam (part of it is still relying on steam) thus saving a
large amount of forex spent on importing diesel and also on imported diesel engines and spare parts.
71. There is a large low-grade coalfield in the south of Zimbabwe spreading across Matabeleland
South and Masvingo Provinces but which has never been exploited. This coal is suitable for
conversion into liquid fuel. This could be achieved through a deal with Sasol in South Africa which
specialises in this process.~ 19 ~
72. As mentioned above, there is a large untapped gas-field around Lupane in Matabeleland North.
Conversion of vehicles to methane gas is a possibility which needs to be investigated.
73. Production of bio-fuel. This can be achieved through the following methods.
a) Production of ethanol from sugar. This is already being done but can be expanded.
b) Increased production of jatropha on marginal land. This has so far been done half-heartedly
but if carried out in a systematic manner could be of major importance.
c) Production of high-protein algae at coal-fired power stations as in Brazil. This process has
been extremely successful and has significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
d) Increased use of bio-gas from human and animal waste. This can be done especially on
large-scale farms.
74. Research needs to be carried out on hydrogen cell technology. This technology focuses on the
splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen and requires platinum as a catalyst. It is the hydrogen
which is the used as fuel. It is a very clean technology.
75. An integrated energy programme needs to be worked out and implemented. Without any doubt,
Zimbabwe could severely reduce its energy imports and possibly could eliminate them.
Water
76. Water is the most essential need for daily life. But in Zimbabwe, a country which most of the
time suffers water shortages, there is little real planning. Dams exist but are not properly maintained
and frequently we find dams which contain water but without means of utilising that water.
77. There are three major water programmes in the dry provinces of Matabeleland North,
Matabeleland South and Masvingo as well as the Metropolitan Province of Bulawayo which need
completion. These are the Matabeleland-Zambezi Water Project, in particular the Gwayi-Shangani
Dam which affects Matabeleland north and Bulawayo. The Nuanetsi Scheme in Masvingo Province
which needs the Tokwa Dam to be completed in order to be functional. The Matabeleland South
Water Project, which is almost unknown, would connect existing dams as well as build two new
ones to create a pipeline for agriculture in Zimbabwe’s driest Province
78. In the north of the country, the people of Harare and Chitungwiza face water-borne disease with
sewerage running into their drinking water. The disgusting state of the water in the capital city of
Zimbabwe is a national disgrace. In Chitungwiza people go for days without any water at all and
then are faced with a brown, smelly liquid which the authorities refer to as ‘water’.
79. The creation of a National Water Plan is clearly a priority for Zimbabwe, both for the
development of industry and for the health and well-being of the people.
Agriculture
80. The recent history of Zimbabwe has highlighted the central importance of agriculture in the
economy of our country. However, in condemning the anarchic incompetence and inability of the
ZANU(PF) government to carry out a land reform programme which is both just and productive,
and the greed of the parasitic black bourgeoisie in grabbing the best land for itself, we should not
forget the historical conditions under which this happened:
81. Under the 1930 Land Apportionment Act and a number of subsequent acts, (none of which
made any fundamental change to the 1930 original), the Rhodesian Government divided the land
into two, the white minority not only receiving approximately the same amount of land as the black
majority, but also receiving the bulk of the best agricultural land. Following forced removals of the
historic owners, the white minority then proceeded to create laws and give themselves title deeds to
that land.
82. Following Independence in 1980, the white farmers, many of them owning multiple farms, with
1000 hectares representing only an average sized farm, consistently opposed any compromise on
the question of land reform, despite the fact that only 40% of their land was being fully utilized.
83. The culmination of this was, the British Government through their surrogate organization in
Zimbabwe the MDC, opposed the Draft Constitution of 2000 because of its land reform clause,
despite the fact that that same constitution limited the term of office of the President, liberalized
citizenship laws and guaranteed the rights of women amongst other progressive reforms. The defeat
of this democratic constitution precipitated the direct action by war veterans and others who had
waited 20 years to see the fruits of their struggle.
84. Nevertheless, the white farmers were generally competent at their job and the programme of
removing them totally from the land was both wrong and foolish, more especially given the fact that
the defeat of US backed forces in DRC and Angola provoked a furious response in terms of
political and economic destabilization characterized by the ‘Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic
Recovery Act’ passed by the US Senate, but in fact going far beyond mere sanctions. Such
situations require the maximum national integrated effort, especially with regard to food
production. After the initial land occupations, many white farmers demonstrated their willingness to
co-operate with government. Fair treatment of those who co-operated would have encouraged many
others to follow suit and the underlying current for national unity against foreign interference could
have been a springboard for independent economic growth and development rather than its
opposite.
85. Distribution of land has been even more skewed. Generally, A2 farmers representing those from
the over-crowded communal lands and the more serious of the war veterans have, with their limited
resources been more successful than the A1 farmers who are typically ‘businessmen’ living in town
for whom farming is a hobby conducted by the occasional phone call to the ‘farm manager’, in most
cases an under-paid and under-qualified poor relative.
86. For the most part, the real producers on the farms, the experienced farm labourers, many of
them of Malawian or Mozambican origin, have been left out of the equation. When applying for
land, they have been told that they are foreigners, and in most cases, when they have remained on
the farms, their truly awful former white employers have been replaced by others who are far worse.
The result is that many have returned to their countries of origin, others have simply become
destitute.
87. There has for years been a lack of agricultural planning. Although the drier provinces of
Matabeleland North and South and Masvingo have been advised to grow small grains rather than
maize, government has continued to wastefully give out maize-seed packs and fertilizer. The
growing of small grains has been encouraged only locally and spasmodically without any overall
plan. Production of crops specifically adapted to dry land, pigeon peas and cassava for example is
almost non-existent. Despite the exorbitant cost of insecticides and chemical fertilizers, organic
farming methods are virtually unknown.
88. Meat production has concentrated on beef. The excellent work by the Matopos Research Station
in commercial goat production has hardly moved outside the Station. Commercial production of
eland and impala has hardly been touched; ostrich production has been systematically destroyed.
89. Agricultural estates, responsible for efficient production of sugar, tea, citrus fruit, coffee and
other products have wholly or partly given to small individual producers, as has some Forestry
Commission land with disastrous consequences for production.
90. Since Independence, successive drought, even before 2000 had a negative impact on agriculture,
yet Zimbabwe has not been able to boast of a comprehensive irrigation policy. Sanctions have
largely interfered with funding of the two major irrigation schemes, the Matabeleland- Zambezi
Water Project and the Nuanetsi Scheme.
The Way Forward in Agriculture
91. There are seven basic problems to be tackled if we are to have efficient agricultural production
coupled with the improvement of the lives of those living in the rural areas:
92. Correction of the mismanaged land redistribution.
93. Expansion and streamlining of irrigation schemes.
94. Serious technical planning of production taking into account the food needs of the population,
export production and local conditions of soil and climate.
95. A charter to safeguard the rights of agricultural workers.
96. Skills training in agriculture at different levels including in situ training for peasant farmers.
97. Special planning for communal lands in conjunction with their communities.
98. Land Distribution
Unless those that are managing the land are competent, or at least enthusiastic and willing to learn
the necessary skills, agricultural production cannot be achieved. Those who have been responsible
for disrupting production and terrorizing agricultural communities must be dealt with urgently. This
includes undisciplined elements in the police and the army.
99. An impartial land audit needs to take place. Those not using land or seriously under-utilizing
land need to be removed. Those white farmers deprived of all their land should be rehabilitated on
the “one man – one farm“ basis. Land must be made available to all Zimbabweans serious about
farming regardless of ethnic background. As far as possible, although productive ability must be the
first criterion, strong consideration should be given to prioritise people who belong to the area
where land redistribution is taking place.~ 22 ~
100. Those agro-industrial estates which have been sub-divided must be re-united. Where possible
the old management must be restored. However, in terms of ownership, the old owners should have
49% of shares, the employees, divided into the three categories of management, supervisors and
technicians, and workers should collectively own 20% of the shares (an employee receiving his
share after 1 years employment and surrendering it when leaving – but retaining it on retirement).
8% should be owned by the district, 8% by the province and 15% by the national government. In
this way, the needs of effective management, genuine indigenization, motivation of the work force
and devolution of power are all met. Forestry Commission land should be restored and even
extended.
101. Irrigation: See ‘Water’ above.
Irrigation is absolutely necessary for intensive large scale crop production. However, where
irrigation is not available, the use of dry-land crops must be encouraged. The provision of maize
seed to dry areas without irrigation is a ridiculous waste.
102. Technical Planning
Innovative and serious technical planning needs to be carried out, which will encourage maximum
land use according to availability of water in the form of rainfall or irrigation, soil-type and terrain.
The “mombes and mealies” mentality must be overcome, as must reliance on expensive agricultural
chemicals. Large scale production of wheat must be encouraged so that Zimbabwe becomes self-
sufficient in wheat-flour and bread. Nutritious traditional small-grains should be encouraged
particularly in the drier areas and milling, packaging and advertising must be established to
encourage their consumption. Potato farming can play an important role in irrigated areas and
produce an alternative starch crop. Commercial goat farming is highly profitable and there is a huge
untapped export market in Muslim countries. Commercial production of game meat also has a very
good export potential as does the rehabilitation of the ostrich industry. Establishment of jatropha
and other forms of forestry on marginal land also needs to be part of the plan. Those innovations
which have been tested and found to be effective need to be implemented immediately. At the same
time, experimental farms should be established and the mechanism put in place which will
implement all those innovations which will assist sustainable agriculture.
103. Agricultural Workers
Agricultural workers are some of the poorest and most exploited people in Zimbabwe. They have
benefited nothing from the liberation struggle, yet they have toiled to produce food for the nation. It
is essential that this situation comes to an end. Zimbabwe cannot allow any of its people to be
clothed in rags and live in poverty. Further to that, if we are to encourage skilled and hard working
people to remain in our rural areas and build agricultural production, they must be well paid and
enjoy a comfortable living standard. It is a well-known fact that people who are properly looked-
after are far more productive than those who are not.
104. The Communist Party must fight to establish an Agricultural Workers’ Charter in collaboration
with the appropriate Trade Unions and other bona fide representatives of the workers. This Charter
should include rights to a minimum wage, decent housing, clean water, electricity (mains or solar),
education, pensions, security, Zimbabwean citizenship and any other demands coming from the
workers themselves.~ 23 ~
105. Communal Lands
Development projects need to be developed on our communal lands, normally in conjunction with
the traditional leadership of the area. Those projects, as with those for agricultural labourers, will
bring clean water, electricity and decent housing to those areas – but they must also become
productive and self-sustaining, not depending on hand-outs
106. When we deal with such communities, we must make sure that no group is subservient to
another, and that each ethnic group or sub-group has its own leadership. For instance, the small San
groups on the western border do not have any leadership recognized by government and are
subservient to local Kalanga chiefs. Similar conditions exist elsewhere in the country for other
oppressed minorities.
107. Communal projects will differ considerably according to local conditions and traditions.
Co-operative and Collective and State Farming
108. Co-operative buying and selling must be encouraged for individual peasant farmers and for
commercial farmers.
109. Peasant farmers must not be at the mercy of greedy transport operators who buy their produce
cheaply and sell at an inflated price. Communities need to own transport on a co-operative basis.
110. Dairibord, Cotton Marketing Board and Farmers’ Co-op must return to co-operative
ownership.
111. The Zimbabwe Project must be re-established to assist the re-establishment of collective farms
and this must be facilitated by government.
112. Where possible and necessary, such as in the Nuanetsi scheme, government must establish
state farms. In some cases government should take over agro-industrial estates.
 
## MINERALS

113. The first principle to be understood is that the minerals of Zimbabwe are the common property
of its people.
114. The second principle is that the people of the province and the district in which those minerals
are found have preference of interest over those from other parts of the country.
115. The third is that having understood the first two, any mining company, local or foreign, which
can provide the expertise to mine those minerals and to market them, will, once a contract is signed,
have those rights and terms secured by government, without interference for the duration of that
contract.
116. In furtherance of these principles, the standard outline form of agreement should be as follows.
Negotiation around these fundamentals being allowed.
117. Within a maximum 10 year period, ownership of any mining venture should be shared by the
Zimbabwean people and a commercial mining company in the overall ratio 51% to 49%.
118. The Zimbabwean interest should be divided in the ratio of 31% to government, 20% to the
employees.~ 24 ~
119. In line with the policy of devolution of power, the government owned proportion should be
divided thus: 15% ownership should be controlled by national government, and 16% by local
government. This should be further broken down so that 8% goes to the provincial government and
8% to the district.
120. The share going to the employees should be sub-divided in three, 50% going to the general
workforce, 30% to middle-management and technical staff, 20% to senior management. The shares
would be equally divided according to category and be given to those who had at least one year’s
service. Shares would be surrendered on leaving the company except for those retiring from the
company. Shares would also be made available to the families of those dying whilst in company
service. This policy would give a degree of control, responsibility, pride and motivation to the
workforce. It would also add to the programme of devolution, putting money back into the
community and creating stability.
121. Interest for potential investors would be created through a ten year induction period. In the first
two years the investor would have total control. The collective Zimbabwean share would rise to
25% in the next four years, 33% in the following four years rising to 51% after 19 years. The
investor would not be taxed and would have freedom to repatriate his money. Contracts would be
for ten years at a time. Should there be a move by an investor to pull out prior to accepting a 49%
share, government would retain the right to nationalize completely with the total shareholding
within the nation being divided as above.
122. Government would retain the right to buy shares on the open market of mining companies
operating in Zimbabwe.
123. Closure of mines must be followed by rehabilitation of land and establishment of new industry
for the community, which should be built into the programme.
124. A mining parastatal must be established in Zimbabwe quickly but not hastily. It must be led
by people who have a combination of skill, dedication, honesty and devotion to the concept of
having an efficient, nationally-owned company in which the workers have a share and which co-
operates with the local people wherever it operates.

## SECONDARY INDUSTRY

125. It has been frequently pointed out that we should add value to products before exporting; that
we should endeavour to export finished goods rather than raw materials. This concept is not wrong.
However, we cannot make finished products without firstly paying attention to the problem of the
energy needed to produce it, which has been dealt with earlier in this document; secondly we need
to properly develop secondary industry, particularly with regard to minerals. For instance, we have
iron, nickel and chrome, but we do not produce stainless steel – before we can produce ball-
bearings and stainless steel pots, we must be able to produce stainless steel. Before we can weave
cotton cloth we need to spin the cotton. We must aim to be as self-sufficient as possible as a nation
so that never again can sanctions bring us to our knees: to achieve this, we need to prioritize, to
understand the steps needed to get to where we are going and not to do things haphazardly.~ 25 ~

## MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY

126. Some large scale companies – Zisco-Steel, Tregers, should be largely under government
control. However, it is in the manufacturing sector that private initiative can play an important role,
especially where import substitution or export is concerned. Those with innovative ideas must be
encouraged to develop those ideas. Venture capital must be made available to such people. Our
universities and research institutes must be empowered to help those who wish to bring their ideas
into commercial usage. In the past, innovative ideas, such as those developed by the Building
Research Institute in Harare and the Matopos Research Station have either been ignored or actively
blocked by government officials and even ministers. We need pro-active officials who see their job
as facilitators of economic growth rather than as blockers. Those who are not interested in
performing must be dismissed. Those who actively misuse their positions for private gain must be
either imprisoned or stripped of their illegally gained property.
127. Like in agriculture, industry can only grow if the workforce is properly remunerated. As stated
in our introduction, those skilled Zimbabweans effectively expelled by ‘indigenous entrepreneurs’
with the collusion of the ZANU(PF) government, need to be offered reasonable remuneration,
conditions and stability in order that they may return home. Without them there can be no growth.
Wage and salary settlements should grow with the economy. They must NEVER fall below the
annual inflation rate. A steady rise in real wages for the working-class actually stimulates the
economy. Unlike the bosses, they are more likely to spend their money on locally produced goods
than on expensive imported commodities, and are more likely to save their money for the future, if
they have a surplus to save. People who have worked hard for their money are far less likely to
squander it than those who have had windfalls of unearned income. Policies must be put in place to
ensure this. Therefore a social contract is needed, but not one which sub-ordinates the interests of
the workers to capitalist greed and short-sightedness – rather one that will ensure a steady rise in the
living standards of the workers whilst maintaining uninterrupted production.
128. No-strike agreements can be made in return for workers receiving a substantial part of
company profits, membership of boards of directors and access to company accounts. Workers‘
organizations should also be engaged in buying shares which are then co-operatively owned and
managed by the workers of that company.
 
## COMMUNICATIONS

129. In the past, enormous sums of money were spent to maintain the prestige status of Air
Zimbabwe when rural untarred roads could not even be graded. Though a huge amount needs to be
achieved in the communications sector, priorities need to be established in line with the general
economic growth. plan
130. Zimbabwe needs a national road-building programme linked to economic growth. Proper
maintenance of rural roads must be the priority in terms of the communication structure. Regular
grading of untarred roads must take place as must the extension of the tarred road network.
Innovative methods of road-making must also be investigated. In the past, most of the wealth of
Zimbabwe has been produced in the countryside, through mining and agriculture but has been
consumed in the towns and cities. This parasitic arrangement needs to end in order for rapid growth
to take place.~ 26 ~
131. As discussed in the section on energy, we need a massive renewal of the railways. Because of
the ability of railways to move huge bulk cargoes by rail cheaply and efficiently with minimum fuel
usage, they are expanding again worldwide. In many cases, including Zimbabwe, private road
hauliers have in the past deliberately and corruptly persuaded governments not to invest in their rail
systems. National Railways of Zimbabwe needs a nationally owned road service section which will
ferry goods from railway stations to their destinations.
132. It is very important to improve rail links to all the surrounding countries. Most important of all
is the link to the port of Beira. It is also very important is to create new links to Angola and DRC in
conjunction with SADC.
133. Passenger transport should also concentrate on increased rail transport. Within the bigger
cities, particularly Harare and Chitungwiza, we need to look at an internal rail network which may
be conventional, underground, monorail or a combination of all three. A few years ago, the attempt
to reintroduce ZUPCO buses nationally was welcomed by all the travelling public. Its sabotage by
ministers was both a tragedy and a reminder of the depths of corruption to which the ZANU(PF)
government had sunk. An affordable, subsidized public transport system exists in every major city
in the world. Subsidized public transport is an incentive for private vehicle owners to keep out of
the city centre, thus avoiding congestion and lessening wear and tear on roads.
134. Private transport operators must keep their vehicles roadworthy and ensure that their drivers
are properly trained and keep to the rules of the broad, particularly with regard to speeding. The
argument that “they are indigenous and we mustn't be too hard on them” does not hold water. The
people they murder through their recklessness are also indigenous. Those who habitually avoid
regulations must have their licenses removed.
135. Posts and telecommunications must be returned to public ownership and an integrated system
re-established. The nationally owned cell-phone service provider should keep its rates moderate,
and the two alternative providers will be forced to keep their rates moderate.
136. Though air travel is not the immediate priority, it is still important especially for the tourist
industry. At this point in time, functioning and efficient airports are more important than
maintaining a national airline. The establishment of a regional, SADC airline should be pursued. It
has been discussed in the past but not implemented. This is an area where private enterprise might
play a role. The success of Etihad and Emirates Airlines in the Gulf should be studied and, if
possible, emulated.

## GOVERNMENT

137. The focus of government must be on economic recovery. The size of government, whether of
cabinet, Members of Parliament, local councillors, civil servants or local government officers is
secondary. There efficiency, focus and relevance to the task at hand is primary.
138. Government which is too large and unfocussed is merely ‘jobs for the boys’ and a burden on
the productive sector of society. Government which is too small and has minimal control is
profoundly undemocratic as it reduces the power of the people through their elected representatives
and hands it to the sharks and criminals who buy, sell and manipulate without constraint.
139. Size, then, must be related to function and performance. We do not need a ‘Minister for
Political Affairs’. But if it is decided that in the all important Ministry of Energy that two or even
three Deputy Ministers with specific functions are needed to organize the energy needs of
Zimbabwe within a given time frame, then it must be done.~ 27 ~
140. Every minister must be given a performance contract or go. The same goes for every
government employee down to the office cleaner.
141. Remuneration of MPs, ministers, civil servants and the President himself must be related to the
salaries and wages of the Zimbabwean people as a whole. Annual increases must be based on a
formula which relates to the percentage increases in a basket of salary increases found in
Zimbabwean Industry. Ministerial cars must be at least assembled in Zimbabwe. Professionals
working for government should be paid in line with salaries found generally in their profession.
When travelling around the country, or to other countries, expenses must be modest as must hotel
accommodation. All government and local government departments must have audited accounts,
with criminal penalties for those who fail to provide them. Most of all, civil servants should stop
behaving as the people who say ‘no’, and see themselves as the facilitators of growth and national
recovery.

## THE CLASS NATURE OF THIS PROGRAMME

142. Because of the specific problems of Zimbabwe, because of the almost total destruction of the
economy by the parasitic black bourgeoisie, we have the situation where most of the working-class
is either involved in the informal economy or is in exile. At this stage there is no possibility for
immediate socialism, but the demand for National Planning and return to a form of economy that
was in place prior to ESAP is attractive to most Zimbabweans regardless of class.
143. Therefore this programme is a multi-class programme of a kind originally espoused by the
national liberation movements rather than by the Communist Parties. The almost total take-over of
the liberation movements by the black-parasitic bourgeoisie has meant that this intermediate stage
of development between capitalism and socialism must now be led by Communists. However, we
must be mindful of the errors of the past. We must be mindful of the dangers of a multi-class
programme — even though it is the only way forward at the present time. We must also be mindful
of the dual nature of the African struggle. Our Communist Party is made up of both former
members of ZANU(PF) and former members of MDC.
144. The ZANU(PF) government has frequently adopted a principled stand against imperialism,
especially with regard to the Congo War of 1998-2003. Many of the positions of the ZANU(PF)
government, such as on the question of democratization of the United Nations are still anti-
imperialist and in line with what we think as Communists. But at home, that government and that
party are totally under the control of the parasitic black bourgeoisie which has plundered the
economy and impoverished the people.
145. MDC, or the idea for MDC came in the mid-1990s after the effects of ESAP began to seriously
affect the living standards of the working-class. They opposed corruption in the ruling party and put
forward the idea of the creation of a Labour Party.
But who was going to fund them?
Following the fall out with the imperialist centre following Zimbabwe’s intervention in the DRC,
opposition forces which involved the working-class on one side and old white Rhodesian capital on
the other came together to form the MDC. Instead of a programme which would advance working-
class interests, there was a totally neo-liberal programme of ‘minimum government and foreign
investment’ put in its place.~ 28 ~
146. We as African Communists must, therefore, advance the concept of the Dual Struggle —
Against Imperialism — Against the Parasitic Black Bourgeoisie — for an autonomous National
Democratic Economy and a prosperous Zimbabwe, a prosperous Africa.
147. But because of the dangers of the hi-jacking of this multi-class programme, we as Communists
must make sure that the working-class and the peasantry lead this process, because the next phase is
Socialism. There will still be class-struggle. Whether or not the transition from a National
Democratic economy to a Socialist economy is relatively smooth or requires a militant or even
violent revolution will depend on the strength of the working-class and the leadership of the
Zimbabwe Communist Party,
