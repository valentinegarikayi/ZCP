"The Patriot" and outlets like it serve as a propaganda and ideological enforcement tool for reactionary government forces in Zimbabwe, particularly those aligned with the ruling ZANU-PF party. It plays a strategic role in reinforcing state narratives, delegitimizing opposition—especially from the left—and maintaining the ideological boundaries that protect the ruling elite from grassroots challenges. Here's how it functions in that capacity:

## Guardian of the Liberation Narrative

The Patriot constantly invokes Zimbabwe’s liberation struggle to legitimize the current regime. By tying contemporary governance to the anti-colonial legacy, it creates a moral high ground that discourages critique. Any political alternative, especially one that uses the language of socialism or Marxism, is attacked as either revisionist or externally manipulated.

## Delegitimizing Independent Left Forces

One of the core functions is to attack genuine grassroots left movements—especially those with a Marxist or socialist orientation that critique the state from a working-class or anti-authoritarian perspective. For example, the Patriots attack on the Zimbabwe Communist Party as a “pseudo-communist organisation” was not a principled ideological critique, but an effort to protect the regime from a left flank challenge. By branding these groups as foreign-sponsored or counterrevolutionary, The Patriot helps cut them off from broader public legitimacy.

## Manufacturing Consent and Distraction

These outlets presents a world in which ZANU-PF is perpetually under siege from Western imperialists and local "sellouts." This narrative serves to distract the population from domestic issues—corruption, poverty, authoritarianism—by shifting blame to external enemies. This manufactured sense of siege justifies political repression and discourages mass political mobilization outside of state control.

## Ideological Policing

The Patriot and others act cultural enforcers, shaping what is considered "authentically Zimbabwean" or "patriotic." Any ideology, activism, or discourse that falls outside this narrow definition is cast as alien, dangerous, or treasonous. This ideological policing works to close off space for alternative political education or organization, particularly among the youth and the working class.

## Support for Reactionary Alliances

Though it employs anti-imperialist rhetoric, The Patriot ultimately supports a nationalist-capitalist class alliance—rural elites, the military, and politically connected business figures—whose interests are directly opposed to socialist transformation. It works to uphold a version of "revolutionary nationalism" that is deeply reactionary: anti-worker, anti-democratic, and fundamentally elitist.

## Conclusion

In essence, outfits like The Patriot function as reactionary mouthpieces, camouflaged in revolutionary imagery. They work not to advance the cause of the oppressed, but to safeguard a post-liberation ruling class from genuine class struggle and revolutionary renewal. For Marxist and grassroots movements, recognizing this function is essential to understanding the broader mechanisms of ideological control in Zimbabwe.
