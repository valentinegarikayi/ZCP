## STATEMENT BY THE ZIMBABWE COMMUNIST PARTY ON THE MAZOWE MINE SHAFT TRAGEGY

**2nd October 2025**

The Zimbabwe Communist Party (ZCP) extends its deepest condolences to the families and
communities of the four young men – Alton Sibanda, Prince Gobvu, Kenneth Mhandire, and Tapiwa
Meskano – who tragically lost their lives in the shaft collapse at Mamini, Umsasa Farm, in Mazowe.
Their untimely deaths are a painful reminder of the risks that many artisanal and small-scale miners face
daily as they seek livelihoods under harsh economic conditions. We mourn with the affected families
and call for justice, accountability, and reforms to prevent further loss of life.

This tragedy once again exposes the failure of government and mine operators to uphold safety standards
in the mining sector. Commissioner Nyathi’s call for inspections and safety precautions must not remain
rhetoric – it must translate into enforceable regulations, regular monitoring, and strict accountability for
those who put profits or expediency ahead of human life.

Furthermore, the Zimbabwean mining sector cannot continue to operate in an environment of laxity and
short-term exploitation. Illegal mining, poorly regulated artisanal operations, and reckless excavation
have not only cost lives but also caused severe damage to water tributaries, rivers, and ecosystems that
sustain our communities. This disregard for environmental protection demonstrates a short-sighted
approach by government, which prioritises immediate extraction while compromising the future of both
people and the environment.

The ZCP insists that mining – as one of Zimbabwe’s most critical economic drivers – must be
approached with care, accountability, and sustainability. National resources must be managed
transparently and responsibly to benefit the people today while safeguarding land, water, and the
environment for generations to come.

The government cannot continue to allow mining practices that endanger workers, devastate
communities, and threaten the ecological balance of our nation.

We therefore call on the Government of Zimbabwe to:

1. Enforce strict safety standards in both formal and artisanal mining operations.
2. Regularise and monitor artisanal mining to prevent reckless and unsafe practices.
3. Strengthen environmental protection measures, ensuring that rivers, forests, and ecosystems are
shielded from destructive mining activities.
4. Develop a sustainable national mining policy that places people, the environment, and future
generations at the centre of economic planning.
The lives lost in Mazowe must not be in vain. They must serve as a wake-up call for urgent, principled
action. Zimbabwe cannot mortgage its future by allowing negligence, expediency, and carelessness in
one of its most important sectors.
