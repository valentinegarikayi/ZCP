MADE BY GENERAL SECRETARY COMRADE NICHOLAS NGQABUTHO MABHENA at the Bulawayo Press Club on 3rd May 2017.

Members and Friends of the Press, Fellow Zimbabweans, Ladies and Gentlemen, Comrades

On 20 June 2015, Communists in Zimbabwe held a seminar in Bulawayo, under the theme, “Is
Zimbabwe Ready for the Vanguard of the Working-Class?”
The seminar gave birth to the Zimbabwe Communist Group which, working with the Zimbabwe
Communist League, set out to establish the vanguard of the working class in Zimbabwe.
Following wide consultations, also informed by the absence of the vanguard role player in the
Zimbabwean body politic, the Zimbabwe Communist Group and the Zimbabwe Communist League
have from 1st May 2017 resolved to dissolve their two separate groupings to adopt a united
constitution to now establish the Zimbabwe Communist Party (ZCP), a Marxist-Leninist political
organization whose ideology will be that of scientific socialism. Ours is a class movement, a three
pronged struggle against imperialism, dictatorship and the parasitic bourgeoisie.

We seek to democratize the Zimbabwean State as we continue the transitional journey to a
Socialist State whose economy and means of production are owned and controlled by the collective
citizenry, affording each one of us an equal opportunity to realize our worth, potential and excel in
our chosen fields of economic and social contributions to the country.
Our immediate task is to unite the workers by offering a platform for building a true workers trade
union movement. We sadly note the manipulation of the ZCTU for political gain — workers need
an independent, revolutionary trade union centre which will advance the struggle of workers as
opposed to being diverted by politicians and used as a step ladder for selfish ends.~5~
We seek to unite the workers, the majority of whom have been forced into the informal sector
being victims of the great economic and managerial deception of 1980. As revolutionaries we seek
to embark on an exercise of genuine nation building since our people have been divided into ethnic
enclaves since attaining independence.

The regime has failed to resolve ethnic divisions in our society. Their rule became synonymous
with modern day slavery where humans using the Zimbabwean state machine exploited fellow
humans in the form of citizens — with opposition playing to the gallery of the capitalist world. The
worker and the poor peasant became the ultimate loser in a game of thrones that ensues up to this
day.

As the June 2015 International Labour Organization Resolution 204 dictates, the Zimbabwe
Communist Party seeks to formalize the informal sector, working closely with the sector players to
build capacity and raise class consciousness.
We will work with the Zimbabwean workers based in the diaspora, many of whom are exploited
by their employers in their different host countries, having become economic migrants and refugees
thanks to the anti-people exploitative and inhuman policies of the current capitalist government.
We therefore, in seeking to concientize our fellow citizens, and eventually establishing an equal
society void of classes, introduce the Party for the working class, the peasants and the poor.
Ours is an invitation to the people of Zimbabwe, who for decades have borne the yoke of
capitalism and exploitation in its many facets, to come together and revisit the class struggle as we
also perpetuate the struggle for freedom from both imperialism and dictatorship.
Socialism In Our Life Time!
We thank you!
