# About us

The Zimbabwe Communist Party (ZCP) is a Marxist-Leninist political organisation in Zimbabwe, founded to advance the interests of the working class, peasantry, and broader oppressed masses. 

## Our key principles include:

* Scientific socialism: grounded in Marxist-Leninist theory, with a focus on class struggle and working toward a socialist transformation. 
* Vanguard approach: ZCP sees itself as a vanguard party of “professional revolutionaries” rather than a broad-mass party at present; its current strategy emphasizes internal growth, cadre building, and ideological clarity before seeking electoral mass mobilisation. 
* Critique of existing political systems: ZCP criticises the mainstream parties for failing to address fundamental inequalities, especially economic and social justice for workers, peasants, and women. It positions itself as an alternative seeking to reconstruct Zimbabwe’s political and economic order. 


## Our current priorities:

* Strengthening party membership and infrastructure. 
* Preparing for future elections. 
* Advocating for gender equality and opposing practices objectifying women in politics. 

## Leadership & Organisation:

The party is led by General Secretary [Nicholas Nqabutho Mabhena](https://www.youtube.com/@cdengqabuthomabhenatalkshow). 


It has a Central Committee structure, a published Party Programme, and engages in both theoretical work and public commentary on issues like land reform, imperialism, and class struggle.
