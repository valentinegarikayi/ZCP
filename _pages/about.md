We are a Zimbabwean Marxist-Leninist political organisation founded to advance the interests of the working class, peasantry, and broader oppressed masses. 

## Our key principles include:

* Scientific socialism: grounded in Marxist-Leninist theory, with a focus on class struggle and working toward a socialist transformation. 
* Vanguard approach: we are a vanguard party of “professional revolutionaries” rather than a broad-mass party at present; our current strategy emphasizes internal growth, cadre building, and ideological clarity before seeking electoral mass mobilisation. 
* Critique of existing political systems: we are critical of mainstream parties for failing to address fundamental inequalities, especially economic and social justice for workers, peasants, and women. We are the only genuine alternative seeking to reconstruct Zimbabwe’s political and economic order. 


## Our current priorities:

* Strengthening party membership and infrastructure. 
* Preparing for future elections. 
* Advocating for gender equality and opposing practices objectifying women in politics. 

## Leadership & Organisation:

We are led by General Secretary [Nicholas Nqabutho Mabhena](https://www.youtube.com/@cdengqabuthomabhenatalkshow). 


We have a [Central Committee](/central-committee) structure, a published [Party Programme]( /programme). We engage in both theoretical work and public commentary on issues like land reform, imperialism, and class struggle.
