    text: Comrade Robson Chere was arbitrarily detained by members of the CIO in April 2022.

On 27th April 2022, Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) Secretary
General, Comrade Robson Chere, a member of the Zimbabwe Communist Party was arbitrarily
detained by members of the Central Intelligence Organisation.
Comrade Robson was conducting a planning workshop at Guruve Growth Point when the
officers interrupted the meeting, and arrested the human rights defender without a warrant. Chere
was released later the same day after he was dropped off at the Guruve Police Station.
ARTUZ was founded in 2009 in response to extremely poor wages and working conditions of
rural teachers; the union now has about 35,000 members and operates in all 10 provinces of
Zimbabwe, widening its reach to include non-rural teachers. The union also fights for the right to
education of rural children.

On 27th April 2022, Comrade Robson was conducting a planning workshop for ARTUZ’s
‘Save Our Education’ campaign when two plain clothes individuals, later identified as members of
the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), interrupted the meeting. He was arbitrarily detained for
about an hour on the roadside by the two men. After his detention was made public online, with
ARTUZ reporting the make and the number plate of the vehicle in which Robson Chere was taken,
he was dropped off at Guruve Police Station.
Comrade Robson Chere was then handed over to the CID Law and Order Department and detained
for an additional 3 hours. During his detention, he was interrogated about the workshop meeting. The
officers demanded to know “who is funding [the ARTUZ campaign]” and “what the big goal” is. The
police released him without charges after the interrogation.

This is not the first time that ARTUZ and its members have been targeted. On 27th April 2019,
Robson Chere and fellow ARTUZ members Jess Drury, Precious Ndlovu and Munyaradzi Ndawana
were arbitrarily detained by the CIO section of Harare Central Police Station. The four defenders
were released later the same day, but continued to face judicial harassment into 2020. On 12th January
2021, sixteen human rights defenders and members of ARTUZ were arrested during a peaceful
protest; they were charged with participating in a gathering with the intention to promote public
violence, bigotry and breaches of peace, as defined in Section 37(1)(a) of the Criminal Law
(Codification and Reform) Act. They are still experiencing continued judicial harassment.
Meanwhile, a number of organisations including ARTUZ, the Zimbabwe Communist Party and the
human rights organisation Front Line Defenders, have condemned the act and called for solidarity.
