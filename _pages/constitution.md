# Constitution of the Zimbabwe Communist Party



## CONSTITUTION
As agreed at the ZCP Founding Conference
28th April 2017

## 1) NAME
The name of the organization shall be the Zimbabwe Communist Party, hitherto referred to in this
document as the ZCP or ‘The Party’.

## 2) PURPOSE

2.1)The purpose of the Zimbabwe Communist Party is to build in Zimbabwe a Leninist Vanguard
Party of the Working-Class and Peasantry and to lead these two classes together with the stratum of
Revolutionary Intellectuals to capture state power and to build the a National Democratic Economy
in Zimbabwe as a transitional stage towards the building of Socialism and Communism.
2.1.1) As Revolutionary Nationalists, we understand the importance of National Unity regardless of
ethnic origin but mindful of the diversity of the Zimbabwean people. Revolutionary Nationalism
linked to Devolution of Power creates an ideological balance and a driving force for building the
National Economy and for uniting the country against either economic or military aggression.
2.1.2) As Pan-Africanists we see ourselves as part of the movement which will bring economic
liberation to the whole of Africa; as Communists we see that liberation in class terms, as centred
around the interests of the Working-Class and Peasantry.
2.1.2) As Proletarian Internationalists we see ourselves as the Zimbabwean contingent of the world
movement fighting for the global revolutionary transition from capitalism at its imperialist stage to
socialism.
2.2) The ZCP will pursue its goals by means of educating, organizing and mobilizing the WorkingClass, Peasants and all progressive sections of society in support of our Party and its objectives of
advancing the National Democratic Revolution through the building of a production driven National
Democratic Economy.
2.3) The Vanguard role of the Party cannot be achieved through proclamation but only through
collective organization and individual hard work; only through this means can the ZCP earn the
recognition of the Working-Class and the Working People as a whole as their Vanguard Party.
2.4) The ultimate aim of the ZCP is the building of a Communist Society in which all forms of
exploitation of person by person will have ended. In Zimbabwe this will require the establishment
of a National Democratic Economy as a transitional stage, and the building of Socialism as the next
stage as we move towards the creation of a stable, prosperous and classless Communist Society.

3) IDEOLOGY
The ideology of the ZCP is that of Scientific Socialism commonly referred to as Marxism-Leninism
and of non-racist Pan-Africanism as promoted by Kwame Nkrumah in African Socialism Revisited.
The Communist analysis of the concrete conditions of Zimbabwe is based on the application of the
scientific philosophy of Dialectical and Historical Materialism to those conditions.


3.1) The ZCP is committed to the teaching of these basic principles and to link them to the Dual
Struggle of the African people. That is:
3.1.1) The struggle against imperialism and colonial domination now in the form of neo-colonialism
and the neo-liberal agenda.
3.1.2) The internal class struggle at this time focussed mainly, though not exclusively, against the
destructive parasitic black bourgeoisie which has hi-jacked the sacrifices of those who fought the
liberation war and have perverted the concept of the economic empowerment of the African people
for selfish personal gain.
3.1.3) The ZCP does not only fight AGAINST imperialism and the parasitic black bourgeoisie, it
fights FOR the building of a National Democratic Economy as the first phase in the reconstruction
of Zimbabwe as a socialist country. The concept of a revolutionary transition to a new mode of
production and the acceptance of Scientific Socialist ideas among the masses is critical to the
success of the Zimbabwe Revolution.
3.2.1) The ZCP encourages the scientific understanding of nature as a whole and the need to work
with nature in order to secure a sustainable environment for the survival of both mankind and other
species.
3.2.2) The ZCP regards the importance of sustainable, preferably organic agricultural methods as
being of vital importance for both current and future generations.
3.2.3) As Zimbabwe develops its energy capacity the ZCP regards the gradual reduction of energy
production methods which pollute the atmosphere as critical.
3.2.3.1) The ZCP regards re-forestation and tree growing for commercial, aesthetic and
environmental purposes critical for the reduction of atmospheric pollution, reduction of global
warming and for improving rainfall patterns.
3.2.4) The ZCP regards environmental cleanliness and recycling as a necessity. Environmental
health reduces the risk of disease.
3.2.5) The ZCP regards the protection of endangered species such as the Rhino and the African
Painted Dog as protection both of our heritage and our tourist industry.
4) The ZCP commits itself to a social order that will respect the existing culture, language and
religious beliefs of the Zimbabwean people as well as the right to express non-religious and
scientific philosophy by individuals and social formations. The Party is committed to the
recognition of the diversity of Zimbabwe and its people and to national unity based on mutual
respect.
4.2) The ZCP recognizes the rights of women as fundamental to the progress of the Zimbabwean
Revolution and will endeavour both internally and within society as a whole to advance those
rights.
4.3) The ZCP recognizes the rights of children, especially the right to food and shelter, the right to
live without physical or sexual abuse and the right to education.
4.4) The ZCP recognizes the rights of people with physical and mental disabilities to social and
financial support to assist them in becoming productive and valued members of society as far as
they are able.


5) AFFILIATIONS
The ZCP follows the general line of the orthodox communist parties as expressed by the
International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties (IMCWP) and will seek affiliation to that
body as soon as possible. The Party also supports the efforts of the South African Communist Party
International Department to re-organize the African Left Networking Forum (ALNEF).

6) NATIONAL STEERING COMMITTEE OF THE ZIMBABWE COMMUNIST PARTY
As the Founding Conference represents the convergence of different pre-Party formations and
individuals towards the common purpose of founding and building the ZCP, current conditions
demand the creation of a transitional national centre, the National Steering Committee (NSC). The
tasks of the NSC are:
6.1.1) To establish membership and organization throughout Zimbabwe and throughout the
Zimbabwean Diaspora.
6.1.2) Establish political education for all members, both ideological and practical.
6.1.3) Establish working committees to further different aspects of the peoples struggle.
6.1.4) Work towards the convening of the 1st Congress of the ZCP based on its structures rather
than on the pre-Party formations. The 1st Congress should be scheduled for 2 years after the
Founding Conference, but recognizing that concrete conditions may shorten or lengthen this time
period.
6.2) During the formative stage of the building of the Communist Party, the NSC has the mandate
to build the Party on both a geographical and a sectoral basis, and will be guided by the principles
spelled out in the document Guidelines on the Organizational Structure of the Communist Parties,
on the Method and Content of their Work published by the Comintern following its 3rd Congress in
1921, which forms the main part of ZimCom Publishers online publication Principles of Communist
Organization.
1. The organization of the Party must correspond to the conditions and the purpose of its
activity. At every stage of the revolutionary class struggle and in the subsequent period of
transition to socialism – the first step: in the development of a communist society – the
Communist Party must be the vanguard, the most advanced section of the proletariat.
2. There can be no organizational form for Communist Parties which is correct at all times.
The conditions of the proletarian class struggle are constantly changing: the vanguard of
the proletariat must therefore always seek appropriate organizational forms corresponding
to these changes. Similarly, each Party must develop its own special forms of organization
to meet the particular historically determined conditions within its own country.
Guidelines: I. General Principles (Comintern 1921)
6.3) The structure of the NSC as adopted at the Founding Conference on 28th April 2017, appointed
the following: General Secretary, National Chairperson, Treasurer General, National Political
Commissar and National Organizer, Deputy General Secretary, Secretary for International
Relations, Secretary for Legal Affairs, Deputy National Chairperson, Deputy National Organizer for
Rural Affairs, Deputy Organizer for Industrial and Informal Sector Affairs, Deputy National
Commissar, National Secretary for Youth, National Secretary for Women, Deputy National
Secretary for Youth,


## 6.4) Due to the problems of travel and finance, regular meetings of the NSC cannot be held in the
normal manner, therefore the Party must make sure that all NSC members have access to Skype so
that meeting may be held online.
6.5) All decisions on policy, organization, membership and discipline are the sole responsibility of
the National Steering Committee (NSC) with the proviso that they must be based on the decisions
of and policy direction laid down by the Founding Conference.
6.6) As the Party grows and moves towards its 1st Congress, the NSC may, after reasonable
consultation with the Party structures, change the structure and rules at any time provided that all
NSC members are given a minimum of seven (7) days notice prior to any meeting at which rule
change is discussed and there is a quorum at the meeting, Rule changing decisions may then be
taken by a simple majority.
6.6.1) A quorum must consist of over half the members of the NSC.
[Thus with a membership of six, a quorum is four (4), if the membership is seven (7) the quorum
remains as four (4); if committee membership rises to eight (8) then the quorum becomes five (5).]
6.6.2) Any NSC member who misses three (3) consecutive meetings without apology is deemed to
have resigned. This resignation must be confirmed at a meeting called after a minimum seven days
notice, but does not need a quorum to confirm the resignation. The person deemed to have resigned
must be informed in writing either by email or hard-copy. Similarly, a member of the NSC who
misses five (5) meetings even with apology must be engaged to decide whether or not he/she should
continue in their position.
6.7) The National Steering Committee shall decide on which bank to use for the safe keeping of
party funds. All party funds to be kept in the bank or through ecocash as deemed necessary by the
NSC.

8.5) A minimum of 3 people is necessary for the formation of a Party Cell. These cells may be
territorial or sectoral. A Party cell must always be answerable to a higher structure. At this stage the
cells will normally be part of the Provincial structure but in other cases it may be necessary for a
cell to report back directly to the NSC.

8.6.1) All members, other than Supporter Members, will be required to be committed to a sphere of
work either directly in the Party or in the mass movement and submit reports on his/her activity.

unable to fulfil his/her duties, that member is required to report back to the Party and indicate when
he/she will again be available.
8.7) During the formative period members will be allowed to hold more than one position within
the Party. However, should it be seen that any member is using this departure from the norm to
build personal power, then the NSC will have the right to intervene.

## 9. DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM
9.1) The party shall function according to the constitutional principles of democratic centralism that
Communists Parties have traditionally adhered to.
9.2) Members are obliged to defend the ZCP and to carry out its decisions. All decisions taken by
higher structures are binding on all lower structures and individual members. Members are free to

meetings through consistently criticising Party policy or individual Members at every meeting will
be subject to disciplinary action.

formulation and implementation of policies.
9.4) All structures of the ZCP shall encourage the practice of constructive criticism and selfcriticism and motivation.

above”. These activities must, however, be in line with the general political line and programme of
the Party and must be accompanied by report-backs to higher structures.

10) GENERAL DISCIPLINE
10.1) All cadre members, candidate members and supporters must publicly uphold and advance the
decisions and programme of the Party whether or not they personally agree with them.
10.2) Where there is disagreement with a Party decision, these disagreements must be discussed
internally. Discussing internal Party issues on any public platform, including social media will be
regarded as a serious offence unless in circumstances where the Party has given space for open,
public debate,
10.3) It is strictly forbidden for any Party member at any level to express racialist, tribalist,
regionalist or sexist ideas. Any Member at any level breaking this rule will be deemed as having
committed a very serious offence.
10.4) Any Party member who conducts their private life in such a manner as to bring disrepute to
the Party through dishonest behaviour, theft, drunkenness, public violence, domestic violence or
other anti-social or regressive behaviour will be deemed as having committed an offence.
10.5) It is the duty of the NSC to deal with serious cases of indiscipline. The NSC has the right to
suspend or expel members at any level. However, discussion and counselling of offenders should be
used as far as possible.
10.5.1) A distinction must be made between genuine, committed Party members who commit an
offence and those who by their actions demonstrate that they are following a personal or political
agenda opposed to the general line of the Party and its leadership. As the Party grows, it will be the
responsibility of the NSC in consultation with lower structures and individual members to put into
place disciplinary procedures and to set up Disciplinary Committees which will administer those
procedures.
10.5.2) While the Party is still small, discipline will be carried out directly by Regional Committees
with right of appeal to the NSC and finally to the National Congress.

submit statements of income and expenditure to the NSC at intervals to be determined by it. under
the direction of a Finance Committee appointed by the NSC.

14) MEMBERSHIP OF OTHER POLITICAL PARTIES AND FORMATIONS
The ZCP at this juncture has no immediate intention of being standing for election. It allows and
even encourages ZCP members and groups to be active in electoral parties so long as they uphold
the general line of the ZCP within those parties. Where dual membership is not allowed by other
parties, communist groups will be encouraged within those organizations in liaison with the ZCP
but without formal membership.


## 14.1) ZCP members should not simultaneously hold senior positions in both the ZCP and another
political party.
14.2) Dual membership of the ZCP and other organizations claiming to be ‘Communist’, ‘Vanguard
Parties’ and in particular Trotskyist organizations is forbidden.

15) CONDUCT OF MEETINGS
15.1) ZCP meetings must be divided into political education meetings and business meetings. The
aim of all our meetings must be to give direction and information to those working in the struggle
and also to impart enthusiasm to members, and where meetings are open, to encourage new
members to join.
15.2) Meetings will normally start with the singing of the first verse of The Internationale and end
with the singing of the first verse of The Red Flag. [The Internationale was originally written in
French and there are a number of different English versions. The ZCP will use the version used by
the SACP].
15.3) Political education meetings should normally be open to both members and non-members but
with the right of the ZCP to exclude any person or persons likely to disrupt the meeting either
physically or by other means. The meetings may be preceded by the singing of revolutionary songs.
If there is a series based on a particular written work, the tutor will encourage individual members
of the class to prepare introductions. The atmosphere should be more relaxed than for business
meetings.
15.4) Business meetings should be formal. So long as members have been given at least 5 days
notice, 2 members represent a quorum and meetings must begin at the time stipulated. Decisions
taken by those who have arrived on time become binding on late-comers.
Unless there is a special reason, meetings should be conducted thus:
15.4.1) Singing of The Internationale.
15.4.2) 10 minute political introduction which should be topical, followed by 10 minutes debate. If
there is need for a decision based on the political decision it must be recorded. Different comrades
should be encouraged to give the introduction. Sometimes there may be a guest speaker at this
point.
15.4.3) Minutes of previous meeting to be read with particular reference to the implementation of
decisions.
15.4.4) Any Special Business
15.4.5) Any Other Business.
15.4.6) Singing of The Red Flag
15.5) Chairing of meetings should be carried out in such a way as to encourage consensus on action.
The Chair must allow adequate debate over any issue without allowing the meeting to drag on
unnecessarily. Once all have had a say, the Chair must seek consensus and if that is not forthcoming
must move to a vote before moving to the next business.


## 15.5.1) All Cadre Members have a vote, Candidate Members may speak but not vote.
15.5.2) The Chair normally has one vote the same as all other members.
15.5.2.1) All new resolutions or propositions which do not have a simple majority fall.
15.5.2.2) Only in the case of an “either or” decision [for instance if there is a tied vote over whether
a meeting be held at venue A or venue B] does the Chair have an extra, casting vote.
15.6) Minute taking must normally be done by the Secretary of the structure, however the structure
which is conducting the meeting may at its discretion either permanently or temporarily appoint a
Minutes Secretary.
15.6.1) Normally the Minutes Secretary should record only decisions and the names of those
entrusted to carry out decisions. There is no need to record every word said. However any Comrade
strongly opposed to a decision has the right to insist that his/her opposition be minuted.

16) ZimCom PUBLISHERS
ZimCom Publishers is a wholly owned subsidiary of the ZCP. The name ZimCom may also be used
in connection with or as an alternative name for the Party. ZimCom Publishers exists to publish
classic documents of the Communist movement, the African and anti-imperialist struggle or new
theoretical or historical writing in an attractive format with extensive explanatory notes. At present
all documents are on online PDF format, but it is intended that publications should in future be
produced in pocket-sized A6 hard copy.

17) PARTY JOURNAL
The official journal of the Zimbabwe Communist Part is Vanguard. The object of Vanguard is to
educate, agitate and organize the Party membership and those close to it. Its duty is to reflect the
collective view of the Party as determined by the Founding Conference, future Congresses and the
decisions of the leading organs. Views at variance with the collective decisions may, at times, be
expressed through signed articles. Articles from other Communist Parties, other progressive
organizations or even, on occasions, from reactionary sources, may be published so long as:
17.1) The article is informative and thus assists our cadres in their political understanding.
17.2) The origin of the article is clearly indicated.
PLEASE REMEMBER: BUSINESS MEETINGS ARE NOT POLITICAL ACTIVITY, THEY
ONLY PLAN POLITICAL ACTIVITY. POLITICAL ACTIVITY TAKES PLACE WHEN
COMMUNISTS INTERACT WITH THE MASSES


## THE INTERNATIONALE
Arise ye prisoners of starvation
Arise ye toilers of the earth
For reason thunders new creation
Tis a better world in birth
Never more traditions chains shall bind us
Arise ye toilers, no more in thrall
The earth shall rise on new foundations
We are but naught: we shall be all
Then comrades come rally,
Tis the last fight we face
The Internationale
Unites the human race. (REPEAT)


## THE RED FLAG

## The people’s flag is deepest red
It shrouded oft our martyred dead
And ere their limbs grew stiff and cold
Their heart’s blood dyed its every fold
Then raise the scarlet standard high
Within its shade we’ll live and die
Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer
We’ll keep the Red Flag flying here
