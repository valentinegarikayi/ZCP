# Red October Address  
### Delivered by the General Secretary of the Zimbabwe Communist Party
**Date:** 8 November 2025

## Opening Remarks

Revolutionary greetings, comrades!

Firstly, we express our appreciation to the **Zimbabwe Republic Police** for allowing us to gather here today.  
This may seem unusual, but in October 2015, when the **Zimbabwe Communist Group** and **Zimbabwe Communist League** who later united as the **Zimbabwe Communist Party (ZCP)** sought to commemorate the **Great October Socialist Revolution** here in Bulawayo, we were denied permission.

Again, in October 2023, our attempt to launch the **Red October Campaign** in Redcliff, Kwekwe, was refused.  
We hope that today marks a turning point, and that the authorities will respect the role of Communists in Zimbabwe’s liberation struggle.

> “If the police and the entire security forces understand the history of our struggle against colonialism and imperialism, they will know that we Communists must be accorded respect in this country.”

By according respect to us, they honour the great contributions of **the USSR, China, Cuba**, and the entire socialist bloc who trained, armed, and supported our liberation movements — both **ZPRA** and **ZANLA**.

## The Role of the Zimbabwe Communist Party

Comrades, let us be clear:  
The **Zimbabwe Communist Party (ZCP)** is the only truly revolutionary party in this country. Others may use revolutionary language, but they lack the ideological foundation and historical continuity of our movement.

Before turning to our theme, let me, on behalf of the **ZCP Central Committee**, express gratitude to the **South African Communist Party (SACP)** for sending a delegate to deliver a political lecture.  
We also extend revolutionary greetings to all **Communist and Workers’ Parties** across the world who assist us in building the vanguard of the working class and peasantry in Zimbabwe.

As Communists, we engage with any party, group, or individual in Zimbabwe willing to engage honestly in pursuit of justice, equality, and socialism.

## The Theme: Living Conditions After Independence

> “It was commonly believed that when the Union Jack was lowered and the Zimbabwe flag was raised on 18th April 1980, the liberation struggle was over.”

The **Red Star** was right there on our new flag.  
Many believed that soon we would see **social ownership of the means of production** — that Zimbabwe would be owned collectively by its people.

But the reality proved otherwise.  
The **economic system remained capitalist**, and while political power changed hands, economic power stayed largely in the same structures of exploitation.  
Workers, peasants, and the poor continued to suffer, while a small elite amassed wealth.

## The ESAP Era: Capitalism Repackaged

In the 1990s, the **Economic Structural Adjustment Programme (ESAP)**, imposed under the dictates of the **IMF and World Bank**, deepened the suffering of our people.  
Public services collapsed, industries were shut down, and thousands lost their jobs.  
This was not reform — it was **counter-revolution**.

As a result, the working class became fragmented and disorganised. The trade union movement, once a pillar of resistance, was weakened and depoliticised.  
Meanwhile, corruption and crony capitalism flourished.

## The Inclusive Government and the Illusion of Change

The **Government of National Unity (2009–2013)** created the illusion of political stability.  
But in practice, it strengthened neoliberal economics, privatisation, and the dominance of foreign capital.

The **ZCP** warned that unless Zimbabwe broke free from imperialist control, the people would continue to bear the burden of capitalist crisis.  
We were proven right.

## State Capitalism and the Path to Socialism

> “Our immediate task is to complete the liberation of Zimbabwe — build a National Democratic Economy linked to Devolution of Power to the People before we transit to socialism.”

We must understand that we cannot implement socialism overnight.  
The transition requires **state capitalism** — where the state directs economic development in the interests of the working people, not private profit.

This lesson was first demonstrated in the **USSR under Lenin**, and later developed successfully in the **People’s Republic of China** under *Socialism with Chinese Characteristics*.

The **ZCP** upholds that the state must control key sectors of the economy — land, minerals, and strategic industries — while ensuring that profits benefit the nation as a whole.

We condemn the abuse of workers by *any employer*, whether Zimbabwean, Chinese, Russian, American, or European.  
Every enterprise must respect the **labour laws of Zimbabwe** and uphold the dignity of the worker.

## The Global Context: Lessons from the October Revolution

The **Great October Socialist Revolution** of 1917 remains our greatest historical teacher.  
It showed that workers and peasants, united under a revolutionary vanguard party, can overthrow oppression and build a new world.

That revolution inspired anti-colonial movements across Africa — from **Ethiopia to Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, and Zimbabwe**.  
It laid the foundation for the victories of **Cuba, Vietnam, and China**, and for the ideological growth of African communism.

Today, as imperialism mutates into new forms — sanctions, debt dependency, and digital exploitation — the October Revolution reminds us that **history is not over**.  
The struggle continues.

---

## The Path Forward

The **ZCP** does not believe that liberation can come through the ballot box alone.  
Elections under capitalism are structured to maintain bourgeois dominance.

We therefore call for the building of:
- a strong and independent **trade union movement**,  
- organised **small farmers’ associations**,  
- and powerful **residents’ movements** in urban and rural areas.  

These must unite under the leadership of a **vanguard party** — one that is disciplined, democratic, and scientifically guided by Marxism–Leninism.

> “Such a Party is the Zimbabwe Communist Party.”

---

## Conclusion

Comrades, the road ahead is not easy.  
But as the October Revolution showed us — and as our liberation struggle confirmed — **history belongs to those who organise**.

Let us continue the unfinished work of liberation.  
Let us build socialism in Zimbabwe, guided by theory, discipline, and the revolutionary spirit of our people.

**Forward to Socialism!  
Forward with the Zimbabwe Communist Party!**

*End of Address.*
