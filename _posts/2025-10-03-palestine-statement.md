## STATEMENT BY THE ZIMBABWE COMMUNIST PARTY ON THE SUMUD FLOTILLA

**3rd October 2025**

The Zimbabwe Communist Party (ZCP) salutes the brave international contingent of people who joined
the Sumud Flotilla of 45 vessels bringing food and medical supplies to the starving people of Gaza.
Our Party views with disgust the operations of the Israeli fascist forces in capturing Greta Thurnberg,
Mandla Mandela and others in order to prevent food from reaching the starving Palestinian people, thus
emulating the German Nazis who starved and murdered the Jewish people of the Warsaw Ghetto during
the Second World War.

We call for the immediate release of all prisoners and for armed intervention by the civilised world
against the terrorist Zionist State of Israel and in support of the State of Palestine.
We support continuing armed resistance by the Palestinian people against the settlers.
The ZCP is opposed to the unworkable ‘Two-State Solution’ and supports the vision of a single, secular
State of Palestine, ‘From the River to the Sea’.
The ‘Trump Peace Plan’ is nothing more than a plan to disarm the Palestinians; yet another ploy to
continue evicting them from their ancestral home, a plan which started in earnest with the Nakba in
1948.

We salute the South African government for taking Israel to the International Court of Justice and in
particular former South African Foreign Minister, Comrade Naledi Pandor.
We praise Comrade Gustav Petro, President of Colombia for severing all links with Israel.
We further support the Ansar Allah government of Yemen (‘Houthi Rebels’) in continuing the
bombardment of Israel and the blockade of the Red Sea.
What is sickening is the cowardice of the surrounding, mainly Sunni Muslim Arab states in their attitude
towards the people of Palestine and the State of Israel.

In Zimbabwe, despite public support for the State of Palestine, President Mnangagwa has been playing
a double game, in December last year he went to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, which is
legally in Palestine (not in Israel), a visit facilitated by Ronny Levi Musan, the Consul General of
Zimbabwe in Israel, himself an Israeli.

The ZCP urges Zimbabwe and all countries in Africa, to cut their links with apartheid Israel.
We urge the people of Zimbabwe and all of Africa to take urgent militant mass action in support of the
people of Palestine and against further dealings of any kind with the State of Israel.


**Free Greta Thurnberg !!**

**Free Mandla Mandela !!**

**Free all hostages !!**

**Free Palestine, Free Palestine from the River to the Sea !!**
